## 4.0 Color Palette

The FedRAMP visual identity relies heavily on the use of color. The palette consists of a complementary range of colors to create a vibrant and bold energy.

FedRAMP adopted a strict color palette, which is restricted to the colors on the right.

The goal is to produce bright and engaging visuals by using contrast. To achieve this, visuals should use one predominant color and two additional colors used for accents. Try to avoid using too many dark colors together. Tints should only be used to accent or to create a flat shadow effect.
