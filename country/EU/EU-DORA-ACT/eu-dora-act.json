Upon receipt of the initial notification and of each report referred to in\nparagraph 4, the competent authority shall, in a timely manner, provide\ndetails of the major ICT-related incident to the following recipients based,\nas applicable, on their respective competences:\n(a) EBA, ESMA or EIOPA;\n(b) the ECB, in the case of financial entities referred to in Article 2(1), points (a), (b) and (d);\n(c) the competent authorities, single points of contact or CSIRTs designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555;\n(d) the resolution authorities, as referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2014/59/EU, and the Single Resolution Board (SRB) with respect to entities referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (37), and with respect to entities and groups referred to in Article 7(4)(b) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 if such details concern incidents that pose a risk to ensuring critical functions within the meaning of Article 2(1), point (35), of Directive 2014/59/EU; and\n(e) other relevant public authorities under national law.\n7. Following receipt of information in accordance with paragraph 6, EBA, ESMA\nor EIOPA and the ECB, in consultation with ENISA and in cooperation with the\nrelevant competent authority, shall assess whether the major ICT-related\nincident is relevant for competent authorities in other Member States.\nFollowing that assessment, EBA, ESMA or EIOPA shall, as soon as possible,\nnotify relevant competent authorities in other Member States accordingly. The\nECB shall notify the members of the European System of Central Banks on issues\nrelevant to the payment system. Based on that notification, the competent\nauthorities shall, where appropriate, take all of the necessary measures to\nprotect the immediate stability of the financial system.\n8. The notification to be done by ESMA pursuant to paragraph 7 of this\nArticle shall be without prejudice to the responsibility of the competent\nauthority to urgently transmit the details of the major ICT-related incident\nto the relevant authority in the host Member State, where a central securities\ndepository has significant cross-border activity in the host Member State, the\nmajor ICT-related incident is likely to have severe consequences for the\nfinancial markets of the host Member State and where there are cooperation\narrangements among competent authorities related to the supervision of\nfinancial entities."

Financial entities, other than entities referred to in Article 16(1),\nfirst subparagraph, and other than microenterprises, which are identified in\naccordance with paragraph 8, third subparagraph, of this Article, shall carry\nout at least every 3 years advanced testing by means of TLPT. Based on the\nrisk profile of the financial entity and taking into account operational\ncircumstances, the competent authority may, where necessary, request the\nfinancial entity to reduce or increase this frequency.\n2. Each threat-led penetration test shall cover several or all critical or\nimportant functions of a financial entity, and shall be performed on live\nproduction systems supporting such functions.\nFinancial entities shall identify all relevant underlying ICT systems,\nprocesses and technologies supporting critical or important functions and ICT\nservices, including those supporting the critical or important functions which\nhave been outsourced or contracted to ICT third-party service providers.\nFinancial entities shall assess which critical or important functions need to\nbe covered by the TLPT. The result of this assessment shall determine the\nprecise scope of TLPT and shall be validated by the competent authorities.\n3. Where ICT third-party service providers are included in the scope of TLPT,\nthe financial entity shall take the necessary measures and safeguards to\nensure the participation of such ICT third-party service providers in the TLPT\nand shall retain at all times full responsibility for ensuring compliance with\nthis Regulation.\n4. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, first and second subparagraphs, where\nthe participation of an ICT third-party service provider in the TLPT, referred\nto in paragraph 3, is reasonably expected to have an adverse impact on the\nquality or security of services delivered by the ICT third-party service\nprovider to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this\nRegulation, or on the confidentiality of the data related to such services,\nthe financial entity and the ICT third-party service provider may agree in\nwriting that the ICT third-party service provider directly enters into\ncontractual arrangements with an external tester, for the purpose of\nconducting, under the direction of one designated financial entity, a pooled\nTLPT involving several financial entities (pooled testing) to which the ICT\nthird-party service provider provides ICT services.\nThat pooled testing shall cover the relevant range of ICT services supporting\ncritical or important functions contracted to the respective ICT third-party\nservice provider by the financial entities. The pooled testing shall be\nconsidered TLPT carried out by the financial entities participating in the\npooled testing.\nThe number of financial entities participating in the pooled testing shall be\nduly calibrated taking into account the complexity and types of services\ninvolved.\n5. Financial entities shall, with the cooperation of ICT third-party service\nproviders and other parties involved, including the testers but excluding the\ncompetent authorities, apply effective risk management controls to mitigate\nthe risks of any potential impact on data, damage to assets, and disruption to\ncritical or important functions, services or operations at the financial\nentity itself, its counterparts or to the financial sector.\n6. At the end of the testing, after reports and remediation plans have been\nagreed, the financial entity and, where applicable, the external testers shall\nprovide to the authority, designated in accordance with paragraph 9 or 10, a\nsummary of the relevant findings, the remediation plans and the documentation\ndemonstrating that the TLPT has been conducted in accordance with the\nrequirements.\n7. Authorities shall provide financial entities with an attestation\nconfirming that the test was performed in accordance with the requirements as\nevidenced in the documentation in order to allow for mutual recognition of\nthreat led penetration tests between competent authorities. The financial\nentity shall notify the relevant competent authority of the attestation, the\nsummary of the relevant findings and the remediation plans.\nWithout prejudice to such attestation, financial entities shall remain at all\ntimes fully responsible for the impact of the tests referred to in paragraph\n4.\n8. Financial entities shall contract testers for the purposes of undertaking\nTLPT in accordance with Article 27. When financial entities use internal\ntesters for the purposes of undertaking TLPT, they shall contract external\ntesters every three tests.\nCredit institutions that are classified as significant in accordance with\nArticle 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall only use external testers\nin accordance with Article 27(1), points (a) to (e).\nCompetent authorities shall identify financial entities that are required to\nperform TLPT taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2), based\non an assessment of the following:\n(a) impact-related factors, in particular the extent to which the services provided and activities undertaken by the financial entity impact the financial sector;\n(b) possible financial stability concerns, including the systemic character of the financial entity at Union or national level, as applicable;\n(c) specific ICT risk profile, level of ICT maturity of the financial entity or technology features involved.\n9. Member States may designate a single public authority in the financial\nsector to be responsible for TLPT-related matters in the financial sector at\nnational level and shall entrust it with all competences and tasks to that\neffect.\n10. In the absence of a designation in accordance with paragraph 9 of this\nArticle, and without prejudice to the power to identify the financial entities\nthat are required to perform TLPT, a competent authority may delegate the\nexercise of some or all of the tasks referred to in this Article and Article\n27 to another national authority in the financial sector.\n11.

As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities, other\nthan entities referred to in Article 16(1), first subparagraph, and other than\nmicroenterprises, shall adopt, and regularly review, a strategy on ICT third-\nparty risk, taking into account the multi-vendor strategy referred to in\nArticle 6(9), where applicable. The strategy on ICT third-party risk shall\ninclude a policy on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important\nfunctions provided by ICT third-party service providers and shall apply on an\nindividual basis and, where relevant, on a sub-consolidated and consolidated\nbasis. The management body shall, on the basis of an assessment of the overall\nrisk profile of the financial entity and the scale and complexity of the\nbusiness services, regularly review the risks identified in respect to\ncontractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or\nimportant functions.\n3.

The ESAs, through the Joint Committee and upon recommendation from the\nOversight Forum established pursuant to Article 32(1), shall:\n(a) designate the ICT third-party service providers that are critical for financial entities, following an assessment that takes into account the criteria specified in paragraph 2;\n(b) appoint as Lead Overseer for each critical ICT third-party service provider the ESA that is responsible, in accordance with Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 or (EU) No 1095/2010, for the financial entities having together the largest share of total assets out of the value of total assets of all financial entities using the services of the relevant critical ICT third-party service provider, as evidenced by the sum of the individual balance sheets of those financial entities.\n2. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall be based on\nall of the following criteria in relation to ICT services provided by the ICT\nthird-party service provider:\n(a) the systemic impact on the stability, continuity or quality of the provision of financial services in the event that the relevant ICT third-party service provider would face a large scale operational failure to provide its services, taking into account the number of financial entities and the total value of assets of financial entities to which the relevant ICT third-party service provider provides services;\n(b) the systemic character or importance of the financial entities that rely on the relevant ICT third-party service provider, assessed in accordance with the following parameters:\n(i) the number of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) that rely on the respective ICT third-party service provider;\n(ii) the interdependence between the G-SIIs or O-SIIs referred to in point (i) and other financial entities, including situations where the G-SIIs or O-SIIs provide financial infrastructure services to other financial entities;\n(c) the reliance of financial entities on the services provided by the relevant ICT third-party service provider in relation to critical or important functions of financial entities that ultimately involve the same ICT third-party service provider, irrespective of whether financial entities rely on those services directly or indirectly, through subcontracting arrangements;\n(d) the degree of substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider, taking into account the following parameters:\n(i) the lack of real alternatives, even partial, due to the limited number of ICT third-party service providers active on a specific market, or the market share of the relevant ICT third-party service provider, or the technical complexity or sophistication involved, including in relation to any proprietary technology, or the specific features of the ICT third-party service provider\"s organisation or activity;\n(ii) difficulties in relation to partially or fully migrating the relevant data and workloads from the relevant ICT third-party service provider to another ICT third-party service provider, due either to significant financial costs, time or other resources that the migration process may entail, or to increased ICT risk or other operational risks to which the financial entity may be exposed through such migration.\n3. Where the ICT third-party service provider belongs to a group, the\ncriteria referred to in paragraph 2 shall be considered in relation to the ICT\nservices provided by the group as a whole.\n4. Critical ICT third-party service providers which are part of a group shall\ndesignate one legal person as a coordination point to ensure adequate\nrepresentation and communication with the Lead Overseer.\n5. The Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of the\noutcome of the assessment leading to the designation referred in paragraph 1,\npoint (a). Within 6 weeks from the date of the notification, the ICT third-\nparty service provider may submit to the Lead Overseer a reasoned statement\nwith any relevant information for the purposes of the assessment. The Lead\nOverseer shall consider the reasoned statement and may request additional\ninformation to be submitted within 30 calendar days of the receipt of such\nstatement.\nAfter designating an ICT third-party service provider as critical, the ESAs,\nthrough the Joint Committee, shall notify the ICT third-party service provider\nof such designation and the starting date as from which they will effectively\nbe subject to oversight activities. That starting date shall be no later than\none month after the notification.

The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with\nArticle 57 to supplement this Regulation by specifying further the criteria\nreferred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, by 17 July 2024.\n7. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall not be used\nuntil the Commission has adopted a delegated act in accordance with paragraph\n6.\n8. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall not apply to\nthe following:\n(i) financial entities providing ICT services to other financial entities;\n(ii) ICT third-party service providers that are subject to oversight frameworks established for the purposes of supporting the tasks referred to in Article 127(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;\n(iii) ICT intra-group service providers;\n(iv) ICT third-party service providers providing ICT services solely in one Member State to financial entities that are only active in that Member State.\n9. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee, shall establish, publish and update\nyearly the list of critical ICT third-party service providers at Union level.\n10. For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (a), competent authorities shall,\non a yearly and aggregated basis, transmit the reports referred to in Article\n28(3), third subparagraph, to the Oversight Forum established pursuant to\nArticle 32. The Oversight Forum shall assess the ICT third-party dependencies\nof financial entities based on the information received from the competent\nauthorities.\n11. The ICT third-party service providers that are not included in the list\nreferred to in paragraph 9 may request to be designated as critical in\naccordance with paragraph 1, point (a).\nFor the purpose of the first subparagraph, the ICT third-party service\nprovider shall submit a reasoned application to EBA, ESMA or EIOPA, which,\nthrough the Joint Committee, shall decide whether to designate that ICT third-\nparty service provider as critical in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a).\nThe decision referred to in the second subparagraph shall be adopted and\nnotified to the ICT third-party service provider within 6 months of receipt of\nthe application.\n12. Financial entities shall only make use of the services of an ICT third-\nparty service provider established in a third country and which has been\ndesignated as critical in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a), if the\nlatter has established a subsidiary in the Union within the 12 months\nfollowing the designation.\n13. The critical ICT third-party service provider referred to in paragraph 12\nshall notify the Lead Overseer of any changes to the structure of the\nmanagement of the subsidiary established in the Union."

For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Lead Overseer shall assess whether\neach critical ICT third-party service provider has in place comprehensive,\nsound and effective rules, procedures, mechanisms and arrangements to manage\nthe ICT risk which it may pose to financial entities.\nThe assessment referred to in the first subparagraph shall focus mainly on ICT\nservices provided by the critical ICT third-party service provider supporting\nthe critical or important functions of financial entities. Where necessary to\naddress all relevant risks, that assessment shall extend to ICT services\nsupporting functions other than those that are critical or important.\n3. The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall cover:\n(a) ICT requirements to ensure, in particular, the security, availability, continuity, scalability and quality of services which the critical ICT third-party service provider provides to financial entities, as well as the ability to maintain at all times high standards of availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data;\n(b) the physical security contributing to ensuring the ICT security, including the security of premises, facilities, data centres;\n(c) the risk management processes, including ICT risk management policies, ICT business continuity policy and ICT response and recovery plans;\n(d) the governance arrangements, including an organisational structure with clear, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility and accountability rules enabling effective ICT risk management;\n(e) the identification, monitoring and prompt reporting of material ICT-related incidents to financial entities, the management and resolution of those incidents, in particular cyber-attacks;\n(f) the mechanisms for data portability, application portability and interoperability, which ensure an effective exercise of termination rights by the financial entities;\n(g) the testing of ICT systems, infrastructure and controls;\n(h) the ICT audits;\n(i) the use of relevant national and international standards applicable to the provision of its ICT services to the financial entities.\n4.

The Lead Overseer shall consult the Oversight Forum before exercising the\npowers referred to in paragraph 1.\nBefore issuing recommendations in accordance with paragraph 1, point (d), the\nLead Overseer shall give the opportunity to the ICT third-party service\nprovider to provide, within 30 calendar days, relevant information evidencing\nthe expected impact on customers that are entities falling outside the scope\nof this Regulation and, where appropriate, formulating solutions to mitigate\nrisks.\n4. The Lead Overseer shall inform the JON of the outcome of the exercise of\nthe powers referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b). The Lead Overseer\nshall, without undue delay, transmit the reports referred to in paragraph 1,\npoint (c), to the JON and to the competent authorities of the financial\nentities using the ICT services of that critical ICT third-party service\nprovider.\n5.

The Lead Overseer shall publicly disclose where a critical ICT third-party\nservice provider fails to notify the Lead Overseer in accordance with\nparagraph 1 or where the explanation provided by the critical ICT third-party\nservice provider is not deemed sufficient. The information published shall\ndisclose the identity of the critical ICT third-party service provider as well\nas information on the type and nature of the non-compliance. Such information\nshall be limited to what is relevant and proportionate for the purpose of\nensuring public awareness, unless such publication would cause\ndisproportionate damage to the parties involved or could seriously jeopardise\nthe orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or the stability of\nthe whole or part of the financial system of the Union.\nThe Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of that\npublic disclosure.\n3.

Where a competent authority deems that a financial entity fails to take\ninto account or to sufficiently address within its management of ICT third-\nparty risk the specific risks identified in the recommendations, it shall\nnotify the financial entity of the possibility of a decision being taken,\nwithin 60 calendar days of the receipt of such notification, pursuant to\nparagraph 6, in the absence of appropriate contractual arrangements aiming to\naddress such risks.\n5. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c), and\nprior to taking a decision as referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article,\ncompetent authorities may, on a voluntary basis, consult the competent\nauthorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU)\n2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important entity\nsubject to that Directive, which has been designated as a critical ICT third-\nparty service provider.\n6. Competent authorities may, as a measure of last resort, following the\nnotification and, if appropriate, the consultation as set out in paragraph 4\nand 5 of this Article, in accordance with Article 50, take a decision\nrequiring financial entities to temporarily suspend, either in part or\ncompletely, the use or deployment of a service provided by the critical ICT\nthird-party service provider until the risks identified in the recommendations\naddressed to critical ICT third-party service providers have been addressed.\nWhere necessary, they may require financial entities to terminate, in part or\ncompletely, the relevant contractual arrangements concluded with the critical\nICT third-party service providers.\n7. Where a critical ICT third-party service provider refuses to endorse\nrecommendations, based on a divergent approach from the one advised by the\nLead Overseer, and such a divergent approach may adversely impact a large\nnumber of financial entities, or a significant part of the financial sector,\nand individual warnings issued by competent authorities have not resulted in\nconsistent approaches mitigating the potential risk to financial stability,\nthe Lead Overseer may, after consulting the Oversight Forum, issue non-binding\nand non-public opinions to competent authorities, in order to promote\nconsistent and convergent supervisory follow-up measures, as appropriate.\n8. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c),\ncompetent authorities, when taking a decision as referred to in paragraph 6 of\nthis Article, shall take into account the type and magnitude of risk that is\nnot addressed by the critical ICT third-party service provider, as well as the\nseriousness of the non-compliance, having regard to the following criteria:\n(a) the gravity and the duration of the non-compliance;\n(b) whether the non-compliance has revealed serious weaknesses in the critical ICT third-party service provider\"s procedures, management systems, risk management and internal controls;\n(c) whether a financial crime was facilitated, occasioned or is otherwise attributable to the non-compliance;\n(d) whether the non-compliance has been intentional or negligent;\n(e) whether the suspension or termination of the contractual arrangements introduces a risk for continuity of the financial entity\"s business operations notwithstanding the financial entity\"s efforts to avoid disruption in the provision of its services;\n(f) where applicable, the opinion of the competent authorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important entity subject to that Directive, which has been designated as a critical ICT third-party service provider, requested on a voluntary basis in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article.\nCompetent authorities shall grant financial entities the necessary period of\ntime to enable them to adjust the contractual arrangements with critical ICT\nthird-party service providers in order to avoid detrimental effects on their\ndigital operational resilience and to allow them to deploy exit strategies and\ntransition plans as referred to in Article 28.\n9. The decision referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article shall be notified\nto the members of the Oversight Forum referred to in Article 32(4), points\n(a), (b) and (c), and to the JON.\nThe critical ICT third-party service providers affected by the decisions\nprovided for in paragraph 6 shall fully cooperate with the financial entities\nimpacted, in particular in the context of the process of suspension or\ntermination of their contractual arrangements.\n10. Competent authorities shall regularly inform the Lead Overseer on the\napproaches and measures taken in their supervisory tasks in relation to\nfinancial entities as well as on the contractual arrangements concluded by\nfinancial entities where critical ICT third-party service providers have not\nendorsed in part or entirely recommendations addressed to them by the Lead\nOverseer.\n11.
