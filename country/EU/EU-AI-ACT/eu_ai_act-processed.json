Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into\nservice independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that\nAI system shall be considered to be high-risk where both of the following\nconditions are fulfilled:\n(a)   the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I;\n(b)   the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I.\n2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI\nsystems referred to in Annex III shall be considered to be high-risk.\n3. By derogation from paragraph 2, an AI system referred to in Annex III\nshall not be considered to be high-risk where it does not pose a significant\nrisk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons,\nincluding by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making.\nThe first subparagraph shall apply where any of the following conditions is\nfulfilled:\n(a)   the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task;\n(b)   the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity;\n(c)   the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously completed human assessment, without proper human review; or\n(d)   the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for the purposes of the use cases listed in Annex III.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, an AI system referred to in Annex III\nshall always be considered to be high-risk where the AI system performs\nprofiling of natural persons.\n4. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not\nhigh-risk shall document its assessment before that system is placed on the\nmarket or put into service. Such provider shall be subject to the registration\nobligation set out in Article 49(2). Upon request of national competent\nauthorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of the assessment.\n5. The Commission shall, after consulting the European Artificial\nIntelligence Board (the \"Board\"), and no later than 2 February 2026, provide\nguidelines specifying the practical implementation of this Article in line\nwith Article 96 together with a comprehensive list of practical examples of\nuse cases of AI systems that are high-risk and not high-risk.\n6. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with\nArticle 97 in order to amend paragraph 3, second subparagraph, of this Article\nby adding new conditions to those laid down therein, or by modifying them,\nwhere there is concrete and reliable evidence of the existence of AI systems\nthat fall under the scope of Annex III, but do not pose a significant risk of\nharm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons.\n7. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in\norder to amend paragraph 3, second subparagraph, of this Article by deleting\nany of the conditions laid down therein, where there is concrete and reliable\nevidence that this is necessary to maintain the level of protection of health,\nsafety and fundamental rights provided for by this Regulation.\n8. Any amendment to the conditions laid down in paragraph 3, second\nsubparagraph, adopted in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article\nshall not decrease the overall level of protection of health, safety and\nfundamental rights provided for by this Regulation and shall ensure\nconsistency with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(1), and take\naccount of market and technological developments."

The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative\nprocess planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI\nsystem, requiring regular systematic review and updating. It shall comprise\nthe following steps:\n(a)   the identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n(b)   the estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n(c)   the evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in Article 72;\n(d)   the adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point (a).\n3.  The risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may\nbe reasonably mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the\nhigh-risk AI system, or the provision of adequate technical information.\n4.  The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall\ngive due consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from\nthe combined application of the requirements set out in this Section, with a\nview to minimising risks more effectively while achieving an appropriate\nbalance in implementing the measures to fulfil those requirements.\n5.  The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall\nbe such that the relevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well\nas the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged to be\nacceptable.\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following\nshall be ensured:\n(a)   elimination or reduction of risks identified and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 in as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system;\n(b)   where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures addressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n(c)   provision of information required pursuant to Article 13 and, where appropriate, training to deployers.\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-\nrisk AI system, due consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge,\nexperience, education, the training to be expected by the deployer, and the\npresumable context in which the system is intended to be used.\n6.  High-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purpose of identifying the\nmost appropriate and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure\nthat high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and\nthat they are in compliance with the requirements set out in this Section.\n7.  Testing procedures may include testing in real-world conditions in\naccordance with Article 60.\n8.  The testing of high-risk AI systems shall be performed, as appropriate, at\nany time throughout the development process, and, in any event, prior to their\nbeing placed on the market or put into service. Testing shall be carried out\nagainst prior defined metrics and probabilistic thresholds that are\nappropriate to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system.\n9.  When implementing the risk management system as provided for in paragraphs\n1 to 7, providers shall give consideration to whether in view of its intended\npurpose the high-risk AI system is likely to have an adverse impact on persons\nunder the age of 18 and, as appropriate, other vulnerable groups.\n10.  For providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements\nregarding internal risk management processes under other relevant provisions\nof Union law, the aspects provided in paragraphs 1 to 9 may be part of, or\ncombined with, the risk management procedures established pursuant to that\nlaw."

Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system referred to in Article 6(2), with\nthe exception of high-risk AI systems intended to be used in the area listed\nin point 2 of Annex III, deployers that are bodies governed by public law, or\nare private entities providing public services, and deployers of high-risk AI\nsystems referred to in points 5 (b) and (c) of Annex III, shall perform an\nassessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of such system may\nproduce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting\nof:\n(a)   a description of the deployer\"s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose;\n(b)   a description of the period of time within which, and the frequency with which, each high-risk AI system is intended to be used;\n(c)   the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context;\n(d)   the specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the categories of natural persons or groups of persons identified pursuant to point (c) of this paragraph, taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to Article 13;\n(e)   a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions for use;\n(f)   the measures to be taken in the case of the materialisation of those risks, including the arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms.\n2.  The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the\nhigh-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously\nconducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments\ncarried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the\ndeployer considers that any of the elements listed in paragraph 1 has changed\nor is no longer up to date, the deployer shall take the necessary steps to\nupdate the information.\n3.  Once the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article has been\nperformed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of its\nresults, submitting the filled-out template referred to in paragraph 5 of this\nArticle as part of the notification. In the case referred to in Article 46(1),\ndeployers may be exempt from that obligation to notify.\n4.  If any of the obligations laid down in this Article is already met through\nthe data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to Article 35 of\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, the\nfundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this\nArticle shall complement that data protection impact assessment.\n5.  The AI Office shall develop a template for a questionnaire, including\nthrough an automated tool, to facilitate deployers in complying with their\nobligations under this Article in a simplified manner."

However, where the\nhigh-risk AI system is intended to be put into service by law enforcement,\nimmigration or asylum authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices or\nagencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in Article 74(8) or\n(9), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.\n2.  For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III,\nproviders shall follow the conformity assessment procedure based on internal\ncontrol as referred to in Annex VI, which does not provide for the involvement\nof a notified body.\n3.  For high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation\nlisted in Section A of Annex I, the provider shall follow the relevant\nconformity assessment procedure as required under those legal acts. The\nrequirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter shall apply to those high-\nrisk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., 4.5.\nand the fifth paragraph of point 4.6 of Annex VII shall also apply.\nFor the purposes of that assessment, notified bodies which have been notified\nunder those legal acts shall be entitled to control the conformity of the\nhigh-risk AI systems with the requirements set out in Section 2, provided that\nthe compliance of those notified bodies with requirements laid down in Article\n31(4), (5), (10) and (11) has been assessed in the context of the notification\nprocedure under those legal acts.\nWhere a legal act listed in Section A of Annex I enables the product\nmanufacturer to opt out from a third-party conformity assessment, provided\nthat that manufacturer has applied all harmonised standards covering all the\nrelevant requirements, that manufacturer may use that option only if it has\nalso applied harmonised standards or, where applicable, common specifications\nreferred to in Article 41, covering all requirements set out in Section 2 of\nthis Chapter.\n4.  High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity\nassessment procedure shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure in\nthe event of a substantial modification, regardless of whether the modified\nsystem is intended to be further distributed or continues to be used by the\ncurrent deployer.\nFor high-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the\nmarket or put into service, changes to the high-risk AI system and its\nperformance that have been pre-determined by the provider at the moment of the\ninitial conformity assessment and are part of the information contained in the\ntechnical documentation referred to in point 2(f) of Annex IV, shall not\nconstitute a substantial modification.\n5.  The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with\nArticle 97 in order to amend Annexes VI and VII by updating them in light of\ntechnical progress.\n6.  The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with\nArticle 97 in order to amend paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article in order to\nsubject high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III to the\nconformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII or parts thereof. The\nCommission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account the\neffectiveness of the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control\nreferred to in Annex VI in preventing or minimising the risks to health and\nsafety and protection of fundamental rights posed by such systems, as well as\nthe availability of adequate capacities and resources among notified bodies."

Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at\nleast one AI regulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational\nby 2 August 2026. That sandbox may also be established jointly with the\ncompetent authorities of other Member States. The Commission may provide\ntechnical support, advice and tools for the establishment and operation of AI\nregulatory sandboxes.\nThe obligation under the first subparagraph may also be fulfilled by\nparticipating in an existing sandbox in so far as that participation provides\nan equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States.\n2.  Additional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local level, or\nestablished jointly with the competent authorities of other Member States may\nalso be established.\n3.  The European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI\nregulatory sandbox for Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and\nmay exercise the roles and the tasks of national competent authorities in\naccordance with this Chapter.\n4.  Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities referred to in\nparagraphs 1 and 2 allocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article\neffectively and in a timely manner. Where appropriate, national competent\nauthorities shall cooperate with other relevant authorities, and may allow for\nthe involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem. This Article shall\nnot affect other regulatory sandboxes established under Union or national law.\nMember States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation between the\nauthorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent\nauthorities.\n5.  AI regulatory sandboxes established under paragraph 1 shall provide for a\ncontrolled environment that fosters innovation and facilitates the\ndevelopment, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a\nlimited time before their being placed on the market or put into service\npursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the providers or\nprospective providers and the competent authority. Such sandboxes may include\ntesting in real world conditions supervised therein.\n6.  Competent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision\nand support within the AI regulatory sandbox with a view to identifying risks,\nin particular to fundamental rights, health and safety, testing, mitigation\nmeasures, and their effectiveness in relation to the obligations and\nrequirements of this Regulation and, where relevant, other Union and national\nlaw supervised within the sandbox.\n7.  Competent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers\nparticipating in the AI regulatory sandbox with guidance on regulatory\nexpectations and how to fulfil the requirements and obligations set out in\nthis Regulation.\nUpon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the\ncompetent authority shall provide a written proof of the activities\nsuccessfully carried out in the sandbox. The competent authority shall also\nprovide an exit report detailing the activities carried out in the sandbox and\nthe related results and learning outcomes. Providers may use such\ndocumentation to demonstrate their compliance with this Regulation through the\nconformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In\nthis regard, the exit reports and the written proof provided by the national\ncompetent authority shall be taken positively into account by market\nsurveillance authorities and notified bodies, with a view to accelerating\nconformity assessment procedures to a reasonable extent.\n8.  Subject to the confidentiality provisions in Article 78, and with the\nagreement of the provider or prospective provider, the Commission and the\nBoard shall be authorised to access the exit reports and shall take them into\naccount, as appropriate, when exercising their tasks under this Regulation. If\nboth the provider or prospective provider and the national competent authority\nexplicitly agree, the exit report may be made publicly available through the\nsingle information platform referred to in this Article.\n9.  The establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes shall aim to contribute to\nthe following objectives:\n(a)   improving legal certainty to achieve regulatory compliance with this Regulation or, where relevant, other applicable Union and national law;\n(b)   supporting the sharing of best practices through cooperation with the authorities involved in the AI regulatory sandbox;\n(c)   fostering innovation and competitiveness and facilitating the development of an AI ecosystem;\n(d)   contributing to evidence-based regulatory learning;\n(e)   facilitating and accelerating access to the Union market for AI systems, in particular when provided by SMEs, including start-ups.\n10.  National competent authorities shall ensure that, to the extent the\ninnovative AI systems involve the processing of personal data or otherwise\nfall under the supervisory remit of other national authorities or competent\nauthorities providing or supporting access to data, the national data\nprotection authorities and those other national or competent authorities are\nassociated with the operation of the AI regulatory sandbox and involved in the\nsupervision of those aspects to the extent of their respective tasks and\npowers.\n11.  The AI regulatory sandboxes shall not affect the supervisory or\ncorrective powers of the competent authorities supervising the sandboxes,\nincluding at regional or local level. Any significant risks to health and\nsafety and fundamental rights identified during the development and testing of\nsuch AI systems shall result in an adequate mitigation. National competent\nauthorities shall have the power to temporarily or permanently suspend the\ntesting process, or the participation in the sandbox if no effective\nmitigation is possible, and shall inform the AI Office of such decision.\nNational competent authorities shall exercise their supervisory powers within\nthe limits of the relevant law, using their discretionary powers when\nimplementing legal provisions in respect of a specific AI regulatory sandbox\nproject, with the objective of supporting innovation in AI in the Union.\n12.  Providers and prospective providers participating in the AI regulatory\nsandbox shall remain liable under applicable Union and national liability law\nfor any damage inflicted on third parties as a result of the experimentation\ntaking place in the sandbox. However, provided that the prospective providers\nobserve the specific plan and the terms and conditions for their participation\nand follow in good faith the guidance given by the national competent\nauthority, no administrative fines shall be imposed by the authorities for\ninfringements of this Regulation. Where other competent authorities\nresponsible for other Union and national law were actively involved in the\nsupervision of the AI system in the sandbox and provided guidance for\ncompliance, no administrative fines shall be imposed regarding that law.\n13.  The AI regulatory sandboxes shall be designed and implemented in such a\nway that, where relevant, they facilitate cross-border cooperation between\nnational competent authorities.\n14.  National competent authorities shall coordinate their activities and\ncooperate within the framework of the Board.\n15.  National competent authorities shall inform the AI Office and the Board\nof the establishment of a sandbox, and may ask them for support and guidance.\nThe AI Office shall make publicly available a list of planned and existing\nsandboxes and keep it up to date in order to encourage more interaction in the\nAI regulatory sandboxes and cross-border cooperation.\n16.  National competent authorities shall submit annual reports to the AI\nOffice and to the Board, from one year after the establishment of the AI\nregulatory sandbox and every year thereafter until its termination, and a\nfinal report. Those reports shall provide information on the progress and\nresults of the implementation of those sandboxes, including best practices,\nincidents, lessons learnt and recommendations on their setup and, where\nrelevant, on the application and possible revision of this Regulation,\nincluding its delegated and implementing acts, and on the application of other\nUnion law supervised by the competent authorities within the sandbox. The\nnational competent authorities shall make those annual reports or abstracts\nthereof available to the public, online. The Commission shall, where\nappropriate, take the annual reports into account when exercising its tasks\nunder this Regulation.\n17.  The Commission shall develop a single and dedicated interface containing\nall relevant information related to AI regulatory sandboxes to allow\nstakeholders to interact with AI regulatory sandboxes and to raise enquiries\nwith competent authorities, and to seek non-binding guidance on the conformity\nof innovative products, services, business models embedding AI technologies,\nin accordance with Article 62(1), point (c). The Commission shall proactively\ncoordinate with national competent authorities, where relevant."
