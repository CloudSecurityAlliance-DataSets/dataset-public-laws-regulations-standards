## Splitting:

* Chapter
* Section (Optional, some Articles belong directly in a Chapter)
* Article (Name, text)

## Notes:

Splitting it up the eli-subdivision is the "smallest" division that makes sense:

```
<div class="eli-subdivision" id="art_33">
```

We process all the articles/etc, and see which ones are most applicable.
