That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular,\nthat the processor:\n(a) processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;\n(b) ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;\n(c) takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32;\n(d) respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor;\n(e) taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III;\n(f) assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor;\n(g) at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data;\n(h) makes available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by the controller.\nWith regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the processor shall\nimmediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes\nthis Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions.\n4. Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific\nprocessing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection\nobligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the\ncontroller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on\nthat other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or\nMember State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement\nappropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the\nprocessing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other\nprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial\nprocessor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of\nthat other processor's obligations.\n5. Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as referred to in\nArticle 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42\nmay be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as\nreferred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article.\n6. Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the\nprocessor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and\n4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual\nclauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they\nare part of a certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to\nArticles 42 and 43.\n7. The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters\nreferred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the\nexamination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\n8. A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the\nmatters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance\nwith the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.\n9. The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4\nshall be in writing, including in electronic form.\n10. Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes\nthis Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the\nprocessor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that\nprocessing."

Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and\ntaking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing,\nis likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural\npersons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an\nassessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the\nprotection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar\nprocessing operations that present similar high risks.\n2. The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where\ndesignated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment.\n3. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in\nparticular be required in the case of:\n(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;\n(b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or\n(c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.\n4.

The supervisory\nauthority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article\n68.\n5. The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the\nkind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment\nis required.

Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the\ncompetent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred\nto in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are\nrelated to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the\nmonitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially\naffect the free movement of personal data within the Union.\n7. The assessment shall contain at least:\n(a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller;\n(b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes;\n(c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and\n(d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.\n8. Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the\nrelevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in\nassessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such\ncontrollers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection\nimpact assessment.\n9. Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or\ntheir representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the\nprotection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing\noperations.\n10. Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal\nbasis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller\nis subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of\noperations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already\nbeen carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the\nadoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member\nStates deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to\nprocessing activities.\n11.

Such a transfer shall not require any specific\nauthorisation.\n2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, the Commission\nshall, in particular, take account of the following elements:\n(a) the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant legislation, both general and sectoral, including concerning public security, defence, national security and criminal law and the access of public authorities to personal data, as well as the implementation of such legislation, data protection rules, professional rules and security measures, including rules for the onward transfer of personal data to another third country or international organisation which are complied with in that country or international organisation, case-law, as well as effective and enforceable data subject rights and effective administrative and judicial redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred;\n(b) the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities in the third country or to which an international organisation is subject, with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the data protection rules, including adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and advising the data subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the supervisory authorities of the Member States; and\n(c) the international commitments the third country or international organisation concerned has entered into, or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems, in particular in relation to the protection of personal data.\n3. The Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of protection,\nmay decide, by means of implementing act, that a third country, a territory or\none or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international\norganisation ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of\nparagraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall provide for a\nmechanism for a periodic review, at least every four years, which shall take\ninto account all relevant developments in the third country or international\norganisation. The implementing act shall specify its territorial and sectoral\napplication and, where applicable, identify the supervisory authority or\nauthorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article. The\nimplementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure\nreferred to in Article 93(2).\n4.

Those\nimplementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination\nprocedure referred to in Article 93(2).\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission shall adopt\nimmediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure\nreferred to in Article 93(3).\n6.

When deciding whether to\nimpose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative\nfine in each individual case due regard shall be given to the following:\n(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking into account the nature scope or purpose of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;\n(b) the intentional or negligent character of the infringement;\n(c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;\n(d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor taking into account technical and organisational measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;\n(e) any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor;\n(f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;\n(g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;\n(h) the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified the infringement;\n(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those measures;\n(j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and\n(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement.\n3. If a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or\nlinked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation,\nthe total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount\nspecified for the gravest infringement.\n4. Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with\nparagraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in\nthe case of an undertaking, up to 2 % of the total worldwide annual turnover\nof the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:\n(a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39 and 42 and 43;\n(b) the obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles 42 and 43;\n(c) the obligations of the monitoring body pursuant to Article 41(4).\n5.
