Notes on Continuous Auditing"
Organisation of Information Security (OIS),OIS-01 ,Information Security Management System (ISMS),"The Cloud Service Provider operates an information security management system (ISMS) in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001. The scope of the ISMS covers the Cloud Service Provider's organisational units, locations and procedures for providing the cloud service.
The measures for setting up, implementing, maintaining and continuously improving the ISMS are documented. 
The documentation includes:

- Scope of the ISMS (Section 4.3 of ISO/IEC 27001);

- Declaration of applicability (Section 6.1.3), and

- Results of the last management review (Section 9.3).",The Information Security Management System (ISMS) has a valid certification according to ISO/IEC 27001 or ISO 27001 based on IT-Grundschutz.,"The basic criterion can also be fulfilled without valid certification of the ISMS according to ISO/IEC 27001 or ISO 27001 based on IT-Grundschutz, if the submitted documentation meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001.",,partially,"A continuous audit of the ISO 27001 certificate is partially feasible because the existence of a certificate can be continuously verified through the creation date of the certificate and passing an authenticity check. However, the certificate is usually issued for three years and there will be no dynamic changes as a rule."
Organisation of Information Security (OIS),OIS-02,Information Security Policy,"The top management of the Cloud Service Provider has adopted an information security policy and communicated it to internal and external employees as well as cloud customers.
The policy describes:

- the importance of information security, based on the requirements of cloud customers in relation to information security;

- the security objectives and the desired security level, based on the business goals and tasks of the Cloud Service Provider;

- the most important aspects of the security strategy to achieve the security objectives set; and

- the organisational structure for information security in the ISMS application area.",,The top management is a natural person or group of persons who make the final decision for the institution and is responsible for that decision.,,partially,"A policy can change ad-hoc. However, the continuous audit of policies is only partially feasible as the only attributes that can be tested are the last change date and the status of review or approval, as far as this information is stored in a system. The content of a policy can hardly be tested automatically. "
Organisation of Information Security (OIS),OIS-03,Interfaces and Dependencies,"Interfaces and dependencies between cloud service delivery activities performed by the Cloud Service Provider and activities performed by third parties are documented and communicated. This includes dealing with the following events:

- Vulnerabilities;

- Security incidents; and

- Malfunctions.

The type and scope of the documentation is geared towards the information requirements of the subject matter experts of the affected organisations in order to carry out the activities appropriately (e.g. definition of roles and responsibilities in guidelines, description of cooperation obligations in service descriptions and contracts).

The communication of changes to the interfaces and dependencies takes place in a timely manner so that the affected organisations and third parties can react appropriately with organisational and technical measures before the changes take effect.",,"The Cloud Service Provider can define and document the interfaces and dependencies described in the basic criterion in guidelines and instructions. For example, Cloud customers' obligations to cooperate should be described in service descriptions and contracts.

Third parties in the sense of this basic criterion are, e.g. cloud customers and sub-service providers.","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls, that the guidelines and requirements for compliance with the contractual agreements with the Cloud Service Provider (i.e., responsibilities, cooperation obligations and interfaces for reporting security incidents) are adequately defined, documented and set up.",no,An automated continuous audit for critical dependencies and interfaces is currently only possible at a high cost to the Cloud Service Provider.
Organisation of Information Security (OIS),OIS-04,Segregation of Duties,"Conflicting tasks and responsibilities are separated based on an OIS-06 risk assessment to reduce the risk of unauthorised or unintended changes or misuse of cloud customer data processed, stored or transmitted in the cloud service.

The risk assessment covers the following areas, insofar as these are applicable to the provision of the Cloud Service and are in the area of responsibility of the Cloud Service Provider:

- Administration of rights profiles, approval and assignment of access and access authorisations (cf. IDM-01);

- Development, testing and release of changes (cf. DEV-01); and

- Operation of the system components.

If separation cannot be established for organisational or technical reasons, measures are in place to monitor the activities in order to detect unauthorised or unintended changes as well as misuse and to take appropriate actions.",,"Identified events that may constitute unauthorised or unintentional changes to or misuse of cloud customer data may, for example, be treated as a security incident, cf. SIM-01.",,yes,"A continuous audit is possible, especially in the case of changes to role profiles and responsibilities. This would require an initial check of the defined roles and responsibilities by the Cloud Service Provider. The roles that are added or changed on a monthly basis could then be automated and continuously checked."
Organisation of Information Security (OIS),OIS-05,Contact with Relevant Government Agencies and Interest Groups,The Cloud Service Provider leverages relevant authorities and interest groups in order to stay informed about current threats and vulnerabilities. The information flows into the procedures for handling risks (cf. OIS-06) and vulnerabilities (cf. OPS-19).,"If the cloud service is used by public sector organisations in Germany, the Cloud Service Provider leverages contacts with the National IT Situation Centre and the CERT Association of the BSI.","Relevant contacts are for example:

- Federal Office for Information Security (BSI);

- OWASP Foundation; and

- CERT networks DFN-CERT, TF-CSIRT etc.

Public sector organisations in Germany are e.g. authorities and ministries.",,yes,"A continuous audit of the Cloud Service Provider's contacts with relevant authorities and stakeholders can be achieved by continuously storing relevant information on a monthly basis, such as a list of contacted entities and evidence of receipt of a response. A continuous flow of information demonstrates a constant connection to relevant authorities and interest groups. Furthermore, the distribution of the information and, if necessary, the documentation of the handling of identified risks and vulnerabilities could be continuously audited for the coverage of this criterion."
Organisation of Information Security (OIS),OIS-06,Risk Management Policy,"Policies and instructions for risk management procedures are documented, communicated and provided in accordance with SP-01 for the following aspects:

- Identification of risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability and authenticity of information within the scope of the ISMS and assigning risk owners;

- Analysis of the probability and impact of occurrence and determination of the level of risk;

- Evaluation of the risk analysis based on defined criteria for risk acceptance and prioritisation of handling;

- Handling of risks through measures, including approval of authorisation and acceptance of residual risks by risk owners; and

- Documentation of the activities implemented to enable consistent, valid and comparable results.",,"The risk level can be determined by qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative methods (cf. ISO 31010) based on the likelihood and impacts.",,partially,"A policy can change ad-hoc. However, the continuous audit of policies is only partially feasible as the only attributes that can be tested are the last change date and the status of review or approval, as far as this information is stored in a system. The content of a policy can hardly be tested automatically."
Organisation of Information Security (OIS),OIS-07,Application of the Risk Management Policy,"The Cloud Service Provider executes the process for handling risks as needed or at least once a year. The following aspects are taken into account when identifying risks, insofar as they are applicable to the cloud service provided and are within the area of responsibility of the Cloud Service Provider:

- Processing, storage or transmission of data of cloud customers with different protection needs;

- Occurrence of vulnerabilities and malfunctions in technical protective measures for separating shared resources;

- Attacks via access points, including interfaces accessible from public networks;

- Conflicting tasks and areas of responsibility that cannot be separated for organisational or technical reasons; and

- Dependencies on subservice organisations.

The analysis, evaluation and treatment of risks, including the approval of actions and acceptance of residual risks, is reviewed for adequacy at least annually by the risk owners.",,"This criterion applies only to risks that reside within the area of responsibility of the cloud service provider. Risks that arise for the cloud customer when using the cloud service are not covered by this criterion. When outsourcing activities for the provision of cloud services to subservice organisations, the responsibility for these risks remains with the Cloud Service Provider. Requirements for measures to manage these risks can be found in the criteria area “Control and Monitoring of Service Providers and Suppliers (SSO)”.

Shared resources are e.g. networks, RAM or storage.",,partially,"The procedure for handling risks must be tested at least once a year and is therefore part of the standard audit cycle. However, the continuous audit of handling risk is only partially feasible as the only attributes that can be tested are the last review date and the status of review or approval, as far as this information is stored in a system. The content of the risks can hardly be tested automatically."
Security Policies and Instructions (SP),SP-01,"Documentation, communication and provision of policies and instructions","Policies and instructions (incl. concepts and guidelines) are derived from the information security policy and are documented according to a uniform structure. They are communicated and made available to all internal and external employees of the Cloud Service Provider in an appropriate manner.

The policies and instructions are version controlled and approved by the top management of the Cloud Service Provider or an authorised body.

The policies and instructions describe at least the following aspects:

- Objectives;

- Scope;

- Roles and responsibilities, including staff qualification requirements and the establishment of substitution rules;

- Roles and dependencies on other organisations (especially cloud customers and subservice organisations);

- Steps for the execution of the security strategy; and

- Applicable legal and regulatory requirements.",,"The appropriateness of the demand-oriented communication and provision must be assessed against the size and complexity of the Cloud Service Provider's organisation and the type of cloud service offered. Possible criteria are:

- Integration of guidelines and instructions in the onboarding of new employees

- Training and information campaigns when adopting new or revising existing policies and instructions

- Form of provision

Policies and instructions are required for the following basic criteria in which the content is specified in more detail:

- Risk management policy (OIS-06)

- Acceptable use and handling of assets policy (AM-02)

- Security requirements for premises and buildings (PS-01)

- Physical site access control (PS-04)

- Concept for protection against malware (OPS-04)

- Concept for data protection and recovery (OPS-06)

- Concept for logging and monitoring (OPS-10)

- Concept for meta data handling (OPS-11)

- Concept for handling of vulnerabilities, malfunctions and errors (OPS-18)

- Policy for system and data access authorisations (IDM-01)

- Policy for the use of encryption procedures and key management (CRY-01)

- Policies for data transmission (COS-08)

- Policies for the development/procurement of information systems (DEV-01)

- Policies for changes to information systems (DEV-03)

- Policies and instructions for controlling and monitoring third parties (SSO-01)

- Policy for security incident management (SIM-01)

- Business impact analysis policies and procedures (BCM-02)

- Policy for planning and conducting audits (COM-02)",,partially,"Regarding the uniformity and content of the policies and instructions, there is a need for manual testing, so continuous testing cannot be fully achieved.

The communication/provision of policies and instructions can be queried via various registers. Registries for all approved policies and instructions can serve as a basis for reviewing the policies/rejections provided in the usual channels and may be combined with a conditional access check. These requirements must first be met by the Cloud Service Provider.

Versioning after approval by authorised personnel can be automatically audited and is therefore suitable for continuous audit."
Security Policies and Instructions (SP),SP-02,Review and Approval of Policies and Instructions,"Information security policies and instructions are reviewed at least annually for adequacy by the Cloud Service Provider's subject matter experts.

The review shall consider at least the following aspects:

- Organisational and technical changes in the procedures for providing the cloud service; and

- Legal and regulatory changes in the Cloud Service Provider's environment.

Revised policies and instructions are approved before they become effective.",,,,partially,"A continuous, automated audit of the content changes to policies and instructions is only partially practicable at the current state-of-the-art.

A continuous audit of the reviewers' authorisation and expertise does not appear to be effective either, as this cannot be linked to specified parameters of an automated evaluation. A continuous examination of this criterion could therefore only consist of returning the date of the last examination."
Security Policies and Instructions (SP),SP-03,Exceptions from Existing Policies and Instructions,"Exceptions to the policies and instructions for information security as well as respective controls go through the OIS-06 risk management process, including approval of these exceptions and acceptance of the associated risks by the risk owners. The approvals of exceptions are documented, limited in time and are reviewed for appropriateness at least annually by the risk owners.",,"About the Criterion
Exceptions in the sense of the basic criterion can have organisational or technical causes, such as

- An organisational unit should deviate from the intended processes and procedures in order to meet the requirements of a cloud customer; and

- A system component lacks technical properties to configure it according to the applicable requirements.

Cloud customers can use appropriate controls to ensure that they obtain information from the Cloud Service Provider about deviations from information security policies and instructions in order to assess and appropriately manage the associated risks to their own information security.",,partially,"Exceptions to policies and instructions are to be reviewed annually. However, the continuous audit of these exceptions is only partially feasible as the only attributes that can be tested are the last change date and the status or review or approval, as far as this information is stored in a system. The content of an exception can hardly be tested automatically."
Personnel (HR),HR-01,Verification of qualification and trustworthiness,"The competency and integrity of all internal and external employees of the Cloud Service Provider with access to cloud customer data or system components under the Cloud Service Provider's responsibility who are responsible to provide the cloud service in the production environment shall be verified prior to commencement of employment in accordance with local legislation and regulation by the Cloud Service Provider.

To the extent permitted by law, the review will cover the following areas:

- Verification of the person through identity card;

- Verification of the CV;

- Verification of academic titles and degrees;

- Request of a police clearance certificate for applicants;

- Certificate of good conduct or national equivalent; and

- Evaluation of the risk to be blackmailed.",,"External employees in the sense of the criteria are those who perform activities in accordance with the processes and procedures of the Cloud Service Provider. Employees of sub-service providers who perform activities according to the sub-service own processes and procedures are not covered by this criterion.

The verification of qualification and trustworthiness can be supported by a specialised service provider. Depending on national legislation, national equivalents of the German certificate of good conduct may also be permitted. The assessment of the extent to which a potential employee can be blackmailed can be carried out, for example, by checking his creditworthiness.",,partially,"A continuous audit is only partially achievable due to the complications between local deviations in laws and regulations.

It would be conceivable to continuously query the process steps stored in the system for each new hire in relation to the specified areas based on a list of employees maintained in the HR system in which new hires are registered.

To do this, the Cloud Service Provider would have to go through and document these steps applying a system-based approach. The auditor could then use an agent or a connected monitoring system to detect any deviations from the standard process."
Personnel (HR),HR-02,Employment terms and conditions,"The Cloud Service Provider's internal and external employees are required by the employment terms and conditions to comply with applicable policies and instructions relating to information security.

The information security policy, and the policies and instructions based on it, are to be acknowledged by the internal and external personnel in a documented form before access is granted to any cloud customer data or system components under the responsibility of the Cloud Service Provider used to provide the cloud service in the production environment.",,The Cloud Service Provider ensures that the policies and instructions reflect applicable legal and regulatory requirements in accordance with SP-01.,,yes,"Due to the obligation of employees to comply with certain requirements, a continuous audit is not practical as compliance with the requirements can be verified as part of a standard audit cycle

A continuous audit of the granting of access only after acknowledgement of the instructions is achievable as far as the Cloud Service Provider designs the approval system to document the appropriate data (e.g., date of acknowledgement, which data the employee had access to and when). A clear definition and differentiation of customer data as well as data in the productive environment is essential.

With the help of this data, the auditor can perform a comparison and detect deviations accordingly. The data could be monitored using an agent on a monitoring system."
Personnel (HR),HR-03,Security training and awareness programme,"The Cloud Service Provider operates a target group-oriented security awareness and training program, which is completed by all internal and external employees of the Cloud Service Provider on a regular basis. The program is regularly updated based on changes to policies and instructions and the current threat situation and includes the following aspects:

- Handling system components used to provide the cloud service in the production environment in accordance with applicable policies and procedures;

- Handling cloud customer data in accordance with applicable policies and instructions and applicable legal and regulatory requirements;

- Information about the current threat situation; and

- Correct behaviour in the event of security incidents.",The learning outcomes achieved through the awareness and training programme are measured and evaluated in a target group-oriented manner. The measurements cover quantitative and qualitative aspects. The results are used to improve the awareness and training programme.,,,yes,"The concept behind the security awareness and training program does not require continuous assessment and is sufficiently covered by the recurring audit.

However, the completion of the training can be traced via training portals. For a continuous audit that each employee has completed and, if necessary, repeated the relevant training courses for his role description, a clear system-based definition of the necessary training courses for each role description must be carried out at the Cloud Service Provider. The expected dates which the respective training course is to be completed must also be recorded. The documentation that the training has been completed by the employee and, if necessary, successfully completed with an examination, should take place in the same portal.

The auditor then has the option of examining the results of the training courses for employees of the Cloud Service Provider for deviations by automatically and continuously comparing the expected training dates with the actual date on which the employees completed the training."
Personnel (HR),HR-04,Disciplinary measures,"In the event of violations of policies and instructions or applicable legal and regulatory requirements, actions are taken in accordance with a defined policy that includes the following aspects:

- Verifying whether a violation has occurred; and

- Consideration of the nature and severity of the violation and its impact.

The internal and external employees of the Cloud Service Provider are informed about possible disciplinary measures.

The use of disciplinary measures is appropriately documented.",,The Cloud Service Provider ensures that the policies and instructions reflect applicable legal and regulatory requirements in accordance with SP-01.,,no,"Continuous audit not practical, as the associated processes and steps can be tested once within a  recurring audit. 

A system-based definition of the violations as well as the corresponding regulations does not appear practical, since in this context individual case decisions are often necessary which cannot be covered by predefined algorithms."
Personnel (HR),HR-05,Responsibilities in the event of termination or change of employment,"Internal and external employees have been informed about which responsibilities, arising from employment terms and conditions relating to information security, will remain in place when their employment is terminated or changed and for how long.",,The Cloud Service Provider ensures that the policies and instructions reflect applicable legal and regulatory requirements in accordance with SP-01.,,yes,"As part of a comprehensive, system-based documentation of HR data, it is conceivable that the employee will receive confirmation that he or she has been informed about the required topics. This should be requested again at the end of the employment relationship.
If such documentation was available in standardised and digital form, the auditor would be able to check each termination for this confirmation and identify any deviations. This makes continuous verification possible."
Personnel (HR),HR-06,Confidentiality agreements,"The non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements to be agreed with internal employees, external service providers and suppliers of the Cloud Service Provider are based on the requirements identified by the Cloud Service Provider for the protection of confidential information and operational details. 

The agreements are to be accepted by external service providers and suppliers when the contract is agreed. The agreements must be accepted by internal employees of the Cloud Service Provider before authorisation to access data of cloud customers is granted.

The requirements must be documented and reviewed at regular intervals (at least annually). If the review shows that the requirements need to be adapted, the non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements are updated.

The Cloud Service Provider must inform the internal employees, external service providers and suppliers and obtain confirmation of the updated confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement.",,"In a confidentiality agreement it should be described:

- Which information must be kept confidential;

- The period for which this confidentiality agreement applies;

- What actions must be taken upon termination of this agreement, e.g. destruction or return of data medium;

- How the ownership of information is regulated;

- What rules apply to the use and disclosure of confidential information to other partners, if necessary; and

- The consequences of a breach of the agreement.

Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements can be signed by means of an electronic signature, insofar as this is legally binding.",,yes,"The signing of confidentiality agreements with internal employees, external service providers and suppliers can be standardised and stored digitally.

An automated continuous evaluation can then be carried out to check whether all parties have signed such a confidentiality agreement and whether the agreement is up to date."
Asset Management (AM),AM-01,Asset Inventory,"The Cloud Service Provider has established procedures for inventorying assets.

The inventory is performed automatically and/or by the people or teams responsible for the assets to ensure complete, accurate, valid and consistent inventory throughout the asset lifecycle.

Assets are recorded with the information needed to apply the Risk Management Procedure (Cf. OIS-07), including the measures taken to manage these risks throughout the asset lifecycle. Changes to this information are logged.","Logging and monitoring applications take into account the information collected on the assets in order to identify the impact on cloud services and functions in case of events that could lead to a breach of protection objectives, and to support information provided to affected cloud customers in accordance with contractual agreements.","Assets within the meaning of this criteria area are the objects required for the information security of the cloud service during the creation, processing, storage, transmission, deletion or destruction of information in the Cloud Service Provider's area of responsibility, e.g. firewalls, load balancers, web servers, application servers and database servers.

These objects consist of hardware and software objects:
Hardware objects are

- Physical and virtual infrastructure resources (e.g. servers, storage systems, network components); and

- As well as end devices if the Cloud Service Provider has determined in a risk assessment that these could endanger the information security of the cloud service in the event of loss or unauthorised access (e.g. mobile devices used as security tokens for authentication).

Software objects are e.g. hypervisors, containers, operating systems, databases, microservices and programming interfaces (APIs).

The lifecycle of an asset includes:

- Acquisition;

- Commissioning;

- Maintenance;

- Decommissioning; and

- Disposal.",,yes,"The Cloud Service Provider must ensure that assets are automatically captured (in a database). The automatic capture of physical assets must also be ensured. However, it would be conceivable to automatically capture these assets when logging on to a network for the first time. The creation of virtual assets can be directly linked to the entry into the database.

If all assets are recorded automatically, changes to the database can be documented (logs) and these logs can then be continuously evaluated. It is important to ensure that the information contained in the inventory and logs is complete.

If automated processes are available, the auditor can create an evaluation of the changes in the inventory based on the logs.

In order to check the completeness, the first step would be to query all current assets at the Cloud Service Provider. This asset list could then be compared with the entries in the asset management database."
Asset Management (AM),AM-02,Acceptable Use and Safe Handling of Assets Policy,"Policies and instructions for acceptable use and safe handling of assets are documented, communicated and provided in accordance with SP-01 and address the following aspects of the asset lifecycle as applicable to the asset:

- Approval procedures for acquisition, commissioning, maintenance, decommissioning, and disposal by authorised personnel or system components;

- Inventory;

- Classification and labelling based on the need for protection of the information and measures for the level of protection identified;

- Secure configuration of mechanisms for error handling, logging, encryption, authentication and authorisation;

- Requirements for versions of software and images as well as application of patches;

- Handling of software for which support and security patches are not available anymore;

- Restriction of software installations or use of services;

- Protection against malware;

- Remote deactivation, deletion or blocking;

- Physical delivery and transport;

- dealing with incidents and vulnerabilities; and

- Complete and irrevocable deletion of the data upon decommissioning.",,,,partially,"A policy can change ad-hoc. However, the continuous audit of policies is only partially feasible as the only attributes that can be tested are the last change date and the status of review or approval, as far as this information is stored in a system. The content of a policy can hardly be tested automatically."
Asset Management (AM),AM-03,Commissioning of Hardware,"The Cloud Service Provider has an approval process for the use of hardware to be commissioned, which is used to provide the cloud service in the production environment, in which the risks arising from the commissioning are identified, analysed and mitigated. Approval is granted after verification of the secure configuration of the mechanisms for error handling, logging, encryption, authentication and authorisation according to the intended use and based on the applicable policies.",,"The basic criterion applies only to physical hardware objects, such as servers, storage systems, and network components.

Virtual hardware and software objects are considered in the criteria areas (OPS) and (DEV).

The approval process typically considers both the basic approval to use the hardware and the final approval of the configured assets.",,yes,"The approval of the commissioning of hardware by authorised personnel or system components must be digitally documented to allow continuous testing. A ticketing system, for example, is suitable for this purpose.

Both the instance and the verification of the configuration must be stored in the respective ticket.

This makes it possible for the auditor to check the tickets in an automated procedure. This requires an automated comparison of the authorised instance against a database containing all potential approvers. In addition, the verification of the configuration in the ticket must be audited automatically.

The compliant use of the assets can then be ensured via an agent system which checks active assets. The status of this system can then be queried by the auditor for a continuous audit."
Asset Management (AM),AM-04,Decommissioning of Hardware,"The decommissioning of hardware used to operate system components supporting the cloud service production environment under the responsibility of the Cloud Service Provider requires approval based on the applicable policies.

The decommissioning includes the complete and permanent deletion of the data or proper destruction of the media.",,"The deletion of data or physical destruction of data mediums can take place, for example, according to DIN 66399 or BSI IT-Grundschutz module CON.6.",,yes,"The approval of the decommissioning of hardware by authorised personnel or system components must be digitally documented to allow continuous testing. A ticketing system, for example, is suitable for this purpose.

Both the instance and the verification of the complete deletion of the data must be stored in the respective ticket.

This enables the auditor to check the tickets in an automated procedure. This requires an automated comparison of the authorised instance against a database containing all potential approvers. In addition, the deletion of the data documented in the ticket must be audited automatically.

The compliant use of the assets can be ensured via an agent system which checks active assets. The status of this system can then be queried by the auditor for a continuous audit."
Asset Management (AM),AM-05,"Commitment to Permissible Use, Safe Handling and Return of Assets","The Cloud Service Provider's internal and external employees are provably committed to the policies and instructions for acceptable use and safe handling of assets before they can be used if the Cloud Service Provider has determined in a risk assessment that loss or unauthorised access could compromise the information security of the Cloud Service.

Any assets handed over are provably returned upon termination of employment.","Physical assets of internal and external employees are managed centrally.

Central management enables software, data, and policy distribution, as well as remote deactivation, deletion, or locking.","The basic criterion essentially concerns mobile devices (e.g. notebooks, tablets, smartphones, etc.), where confidential information is stored on them which can be used in the event of unauthorised access to obtain privileged access to the cloud service (e.g. if these are used as security tokens for authentication).",,yes,"The obligation of the employees to follow the policies and instructions can be made in digital form. This can be used to create a monitoring system that documents the non-obligation to employee guidelines in the form of logs.

In this case, the auditor can check the exceptions in the form of logs and request evidence of what additional steps the Cloud Service Provider has taken in these cases to minimise the risk.

The compliant use of the assets can then be ensured via an agent system which checks active assets. The status of this system can then be queried by the auditor for a continuous audit."
Asset Management (AM),AM-06,Asset Classification and Labelling,"Assets are classified and, if possible, labelled. Classification and labelling of an asset reflect the protection needs of the information it processes, stores, or transmits.

The need for protection is determined by the individuals or groups responsible for the assets of the Cloud Service Provider according to a uniform schema. The schema provides levels of protection for the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity protection objectives.","Logging and monitoring applications take the asset protection needs into account in order to inform the responsible stakeholder of events that could lead to a violation of the protection goals, so that the necessary measures are taken with an appropriate priority. Actions for events on assets with a higher level of protection take precedence over events on assets with a lower need for protection.","If the Cloud Service Provider does not make a differentiated classification of the assets, all assets are to be assigned to the highest defined protection requirement.","Cloud customers can use appropriate controls to ensure that the need for protection of the information that can be processed or stored with the cloud service is adequately determined.

Cloud customers can also use appropriate controls to ensure that the information processed or stored with the cloud service is protected against tampering, copying, modifying, redirecting or deleting in accordance with its protection needs.",yes,"The classification of the assets and the determination of the need for protection should take place during the initial acquisition of the assets. Thus, the classification should also be documented in an asset management tool. The determination of the protection requirement can also be carried out in a standardised form and stored digitally. If there are changes in the classification, these should also be recorded in logs.

The auditor can then automatically test whether all assets in the platform are classified and whether the classification was determined using a standardised format. For changes in the classification, it can be automatically reconstructed whether these were also carried out based on the uniform schema. For this purpose, the logs produced can be evaluated as part of a continuous audit."
Physical Security (PS),PS-01,Physical Security and Environmental Control Requirements,"Security requirements for premises and buildings related to the cloud service provided, are based on the security objectives of the information security policy, identified protection requirements for the cloud service and the assessment of risks to physical and environmental security. The security requirements are documented, communicated and provided in a policy or concept according to SP-01.

The security requirements for data centres are based on criteria which comply with established rules of technology. They are suitable for addressing the following risks in accordance with the applicable legal and contractual requirements:

- Faults in planning;

- Unauthorised access;

- Insufficient surveillance;

- Insufficient air-conditioning;

- Fire and smoke; 

- Water;

- Power failure; and

- Air ventilation and filtration.

If the Cloud Service Provider uses premises or buildings operated by third parties to provide the Cloud Service, the document describes which security requirements the Cloud Service Provider places on these third parties. 

The appropriate and effective verification of implementation is carried out in accordance with the criteria for controlling and monitoring subcontractors (cf. SSO-01, SSO-02).","The security requirements include time constraints for self-sufficient operation in the event of exceptional events (e.g. prolonged power outage, heat waves, low water in cold river water supply) and maximum tolerable utility downtime.

The time limits for self-sufficient operation provide for at least 48 hours in the event of a failure of the external power supply.

For a self-sufficient operation during a heat period, the highest outside temperatures measured to date within a radius of at least 50 km around the locations of the premises and buildings have been determined with a safety margin of 3 K. The security requirements stipulate that the permissible operating and environmental parameters of the cooling supply must also be observed on at least five consecutive days with these outside temperatures including the safety margin (cf. PS-06 Protection against failure of the supply facilities).

If water is taken from a river for air conditioning, it is determined at which water levels and water temperatures the air conditioning can be maintained for how long.

The maximum tolerable downtimes of utility facilities are suitable for meeting the availability requirements contained in the service level agreement.","Premises and buildings related to the cloud service provided include data centres and server rooms housing system components used to process cloud customer data and the technical utilities required to operate these system components (e.g. power supply, refrigeration, fire-fighting, telecommunications, security, etc.). Backup or redundancy computer centres.

Premises and buildings operated by third parties are e.g. server housing, colocation, IaaS.

Premises and buildings in which no data from cloud customers is processed or stored (e.g. offices of the Cloud Service Provider, server rooms with system components for internal development and test systems) are not subject to this criteria area.

The recognised rules of technology are defined in relevant standards, e.g. EN 50600 (facilities and infrastructures of data centres).

Incorrect planning can endanger the operational safety and availability of the premises or buildings. This can result from an incorrect assessment of elementary hazards at the site (e.g. air traffic, earthquakes, floods, hazardous substances) as well as an incorrect conception of the bandwidth or energy supply.

Time specifications for self-sustaining operation as well as maximum tolerable downtimes of utility facilities are typically collected during the business impact analysis (cf. BCM-02, BCM-03).",,partially,"A policy can change ad-hoc. However, the continuous audit of policies is only partially feasible as the only attributes that can be tested are the last change date and the status of review or approval, as far as this information is stored in a system. The content of a policy can hardly be tested automatically."
Physical Security (PS),PS-02,Redundancy model,"The cloud service is provided from two locations that are redundant to each other. The locations meet the security requirements of the Cloud Service Provider (cf. PS-01 Security Concept) and are located in an adequate distance to each other to achieve operational redundancy. Operational redundancy is designed in a way that ensures that the availability requirements specified in the service level agreement are met. The functionality of the redundancy is checked at least annually by suitable tests and exercises (cf. BCM-04 - Verification, updating and testing of business continuity). ","The cloud service is provided from more than two locations that provide each other with redundancy. The locations are sufficiently far apart to achieve georedundancy. If two locations fail at the same time, at least one third location is still available to prevent a total service failure. The georedundancy is designed in a way that ensures that the availability requirements specified in the service level agreement are met.. The functionality of the redundancy is checked at least annually by suitable tests and exercises (cf. BCM-04 - Verification, updating and testing of business continuity).","Operational redundancy of the sites to each other in the sense of the basic requirement is given, if based on the assessment of elementary risks at the site corresponding distances of the premises and buildings to these risks are maintained. Very extensive events which, due to their extent, could affect several sites of the same redundancy group simultaneously or in a timely manner (e.g. floods, earthquakes) are not considered.

A georedundancy of the sites to each other in the sense of the optional, more far-reaching requirement is given if a very extensive event at a site under no circumstances affects several sites of the same redundancy group simultaneously or promptly. The BSI publication ""Kriterien für die Standortwahl höchstverfügbarer und georedundanter Rechenzentren"" provides assistance in this regard. 

There are cloud providers who no longer address the issue of reliability of the cloud service on a physical level through redundancy from two independent locations, but through resilience. The cloud service is provided simultaneously from more than two locations. The underlying distributed data centre architecture ensures that the failure of a location or components of a location does not violate the defined availability criteria of the cloud service. Such an architecture can represent an alternative fulfilment (cf. Chapter 4.4.7) of the criterion. The tests and exercises on functionality required in the criterion also apply analogously to resilient architectures.","By means of suitable controls, cloud customers ensure that the existing redundancy model of the cloud provider and the evidence for the verification of the model comply with their own requirements for the availability and reliability of the cloud service.",partially,"An annual audit of the effectiveness of the redundancy is only partially suitable for a continuous audit. A continuous audit could return the date of the last transaction to bring about redundancy.

Operations (OPS),OPS-22,Testing and Documentation of known Vulnerabilities,"System components in the area of responsibility of the Cloud Service Provider for the provision of the cloud service are automatically checked for known vulnerabilities at least once a month in accordance with the policies for handling vulnerabilities (cf. OPS-18), the severity is assessed in accordance with defined criteria and measures for timely remediation or mitigation are initiated within defined time windows.","Available security patches are applied depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities, as determined based on the latest version of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):

- Critical (CVSS = 9.0 - 10.0): 3 hours;

- High (CVSS = 7.0 - 8.9): 3 days;

- Average (CVSS = 4.0 - 6.9): 1 month;

- Low (CVSS = 0.1 - 3.9): 3 months.","In contrast to penetration tests (Cf. OPS-20), which are carried out manually and according to an individual scheme, the check for open vulnerabilities is performed automatically, using so-called vulnerability scanners.","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls, that system components under their responsibility are regularly checked for vulnerabilities and to mitigate these by appropriate measures.",yes,"The periodic check for vulnerabilities and the corresponding results as well as the analysis and remediation of identified vulnerabilities are documented by the Cloud Service Provider. 

An automated and continuous audit of this procedure can be implemented by the auditor by automatically evaluating the documented results."
Operations (OPS),OPS-23,"Managing Vulnerabilities, Malfunctions and Errors - System Hardening","System components in the production environment used to provide the cloud service under the Cloud Service Provider's responsibility are hardened according to generally accepted industry standards. The hardening requirements for each system component are documented.

If non-modifiable (""immutable"") images are used, compliance with the hardening specifications as defined in the hardening requirements is checked upon creation of the images. Configuration and log files regarding the continuous availability of the images are retained.",System components in the Cloud Service Provider's area of responsibility are automatically monitored for compliance with hardening specifications. Deviations from the specifications are automatically reported to the appropriate departments of the Cloud Service Provider for immediate assessment and action.,"System components in the sense of the basic criterion are the objects required for the information security of the cloud service during the creation, processing, storage, transmission, deletion or destruction of information in the Cloud Service Provider's area of responsibility, e.g. firewalls, load balancers, web servers, application servers and database servers. These system components in turn consist of hardware and software objects. This criterion is limited to software objects such as hypervisors, operating systems, databases, programming interfaces (APIs), images (e.g. for virtual machines and containers) and applications for logging and monitoring security events.

The configuration and log files for non-modifiable mages include e.g.:

- Configuration of the images used with regards to implemented hardening; and specifications including version history

- Logs for file integrity monitoring of images in productive use.

Generally accepted industry standards are, for example, the Security Configuration Benchmark of the “Centre for Internet Security” (CIS) or the corresponding modules in the BSI IT-Grundschutz-Kompendium.

Compliance with hardening specifications can be monitored with e.g. file integrity monitoring",Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that layers of the cloud service which are under their responsibility are hardened according to generally established and accepted industry standards. The hardening specifications applied are derived from a risk assessment of the planned usage of the cloud service.,yes,"The verification of compliance with the specifications for the hardening of system components can be automatically tested and subsequently documented (logs).

The auditor can evaluate these logs automatically and continuously and thus carry out a continuous audit."
Operations (OPS),OPS-24,Separation of Datasets in the Cloud Infrastructure,Cloud customer data stored and processed on shared virtual and physical resources is securely and strictly separated according to a documented approach based on OIS-07 risk analysis to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of this data.,Resources in the storage network are segmented by secure zoning (LUN binding and LUN masking).,"Shared resources include memory, cores and storage networks. Technical segregation (separation) of the stored and processed data of cloud customers into shared resources can be achieved through firewalls, access lists, tagging, VLANs, virtualisation and measures in the storage network (e.g. LUN binding and LUN masking). Where the adequacy and effectiveness of segregation cannot be assessed with reasonable assurance (e.g. due to complex implementation), evidence may also be provided through expert third party review results (e.g. penetration tests to validate the concept). The segregation of transmitted data is subject to control COS-06.",Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the functions provided by the cloud service for segregating shared virtual and physical resources are used in such way that risks related to segregation are adequately addressed according to the data's protection requirements.,partially,"The segregation according to a documented concept is implemented by means of a configuration which does not change with high frequency. A continuous audit of this configuration could check whether the configuration and thus the segregation of the data is implemented correctly. However, the effort for a continuous audit would be high and the benefit limited due to the low change rate of the configuration. Thus, a continuous audit would only be of limited use here. If compliance with the measures taken is monitored, this criterion can be audited automatically.

It would also be conceivable to continuously audit the actual data segregation. For this purpose, the Cloud Service Provider would have to set up appropriate agents to monitor the data flow between the customer instances (or its absence) on a permanent and documented basis (logs)."

- Two-factor or multi-factor authentication for users with privileged access;

- Requirements for the approval and documentation of the management of user accounts and access rights.",,System components in the sense of the basic criterion cf. definition in OPS-23.

Approval from authorised personnel or system components are required to unlock these accounts.

Locked user accounts are automatically revoked after six months. After revocation, the procedure for granting user accounts and access rights (cf. IDM-02) must be repeated.",,"Locking can result from a longer absence of the employee, for example, due to illness, parental leave, or sabbatical.",,yes,Automated processes can easily be included in the continuous audit. Appropriate evaluation and reporting mechanisms must be used by the Cloud Service Provider. The auditor must use data analyses to detect deviations.
Identity and Access Management (IDM),IDM-04,Withdraw or adjust access rights as the task area changes,"Access rights are promptly revoked if the job responsibilities of the Cloud Service Provider's internal or external staff or the tasks of system components involved in the Cloud Service Provider's automated authorisation processes change. Privileged access rights are adjusted or revoked within 48 hours after the change taking effect. All other access rights are adjusted or revoked within 14 days. After revocation, the procedure for granting user accounts and access rights (cf. IDM-02) must be repeated.",,"Changes in the task area of internal and external employees can be triggered by changes in the employment relationship (e.g. termination, transfer) or in contracts and agreements. For privileged access rights the definition in IDM-06 applies.",,yes,It is necessary to record the changes to the task area in terms of content together with the date of entry into force in order to compare these with the adjustments made to the access rights.

Identity and Access Management (IDM),IDM-05,Regular review of access rights,"Access rights of internal and external employees of the Cloud Service Provider as well as of system components that play a role in automated authorisation processes of the Cloud Service Provider are reviewed at least once a year to ensure that they still correspond to the actual area of use. The review is carried out by authorised persons from the Cloud Service Provider's organisational units, who can assess the appropriateness of the assigned access rights based on their knowledge of the task areas of the employees or system components. Identified deviations will be dealt with promptly, but no later than 7 days after their detection, by appropriate modification or withdrawal of the access rights.",Privileged access rights are reviewed at least every six months. ,,,yes,The review audit cannot be recorded automatically. A registration of documents used for documentary purposes could take place (e.g. confirmation that the assignment of the access rights has been reviewed). A continuous audit could indicate when this review was last carried out. The Cloud Service Provider must automate the review process (in particular the confirmation that the review has been performed) so that the auditor can audit the steps to be performed in case deviations are detected.
Identity and Access Management (IDM),IDM-06,Privileged access rights,"Privileged access rights for internal and external employees as well as technical users of the Cloud Service Provider are assigned and changed in accordance to the policy for managing user accounts and access rights (cf. IDM-01) or a separate specific policy.

Privileged access rights are personalised, limited in time according to a risk assessment and assigned as necessary for the execution of tasks (""need-to-know principle""). Technical users are assigned to internal or external employees of the Cloud Service Provider.

Activities of users with privileged access rights are logged in order to detect any misuse of privileged access in suspicious cases. The logged information is automatically monitored for defined events that may indicate misuse. When such an event is identified, the responsible personnel are automatically informed so that they can promptly assess whether misuse has occurred and take corresponding action. In the event of proven misuse of privileged access rights, disciplinary measures are taken in accordance with HR-04.",,"Privileged access rights in the sense of the Basic Criterion are those that enable employees of the Cloud Service Provider to perform any of the following activities: 

- Read or write access to the cloud customers' data processed, stored or transmitted in the cloud service, unless such data is encrypted or the encryption can be deactivated for access by the Cloud Service Provider; and

- Changes to the operational and/or security configuration of the system components in the production environment, in particular the starting, stopping, deleting or deactivating of system components, if this can affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the data of the cloud customers (also indirectly, e.g. by deactivating the logging and monitoring of security-relevant events). Misused privileged access rights can be treated e.g. as a security incident, cf. SIM-01.",,partially,"The assignment of audit authorisations must be audited manually. This includes the classification as privileged, personalisation, and evaluation of the need-to-know principle. The time limit could be read, but the implementation effort would be very high. A continuous audit does not appear to be sensible here. Only the system status could be audited continuously. The automatic triggering of a notification in suspicious cases could be compared with documented measures to handle these cases. However, this entire process must be digitised for this purpose, and the effort involved currently appears to be very high. However, a continuous audit could show the time of the last manual audit."

The information is provided in accordance with the contractual agreements, or within 72 hours after the access.","Access to the data processed, stored or transmitted in the cloud service by internal or external employees of the Cloud Service Provider requires the prior consent of an authorised department of the cloud customer, provided that the cloud customer's data is not encrypted, encryption is disabled for access, or contractual agreements do not explicitly exclude such consent. For the consent, the cloud customer's department is provided with meaningful information about the cause, time, duration, type and scope of the access supporting assessing the risks associated with the access.","Subject matter experts in the sense of this basic criterion is personnel from e.g. IT, Compliance or Internal Audit. ",,yes,"A continuous audit of the notifications carried out only appears practical if the accesses mentioned are also logged and classified automatically. The content of the notifications can only be audited if the content is specified by the Cloud Service Provider according to a specific scheme. Then, a comparison and plausibility check can take place. A continuous audit would test all notifications after they have been received and thus check whether the process has been executed correctly in all cases."
Identity and Access Management (IDM),IDM-08,Confidentiality of authentication information,"The allocation of authentication information to access system components used to provide the cloud service to internal and external users of the cloud provider and system components that are involved in automated authorisation processes of the cloud provider is done in an orderly manner that ensures the confidentiality of the information. If passwords are used as authentication information, their confidentiality is ensured by the following procedures, as far as technically possible: 

- Users can initially create the password themselves or must change an initial password when logging on to the system component for the first time. An initial password loses its validity after a maximum of 14 days.

- When creating passwords, compliance with the password specifications (cf. IDM-09) is enforced as far as technically possible.

- The user is informed about changing or resetting the password.

- The server-side storage takes place using cryptographically strong hash functions.

Deviations are evaluated by means of a risk analysis and mitigating measures derived from this are implemented.",The users sign a declaration in which they assure that they treat personal (or shared) authentication information confidentially and keep it exclusively for themselves (within the members of the group).,"Argon2i, for example, is suitable for using a password hash function.

Within the production environment, user authentication takes place through passwords, digitally signed certificates or procedures that achieve at least an equivalent level of security. If digitally signed certificates are used, administration is carried out in accordance with the Guideline for Key Management (cf. CRY-01). The password requirements are derived from a risk assessment and documented, communicated and provided in a password policy according to SP-01. Compliance with the requirements is enforced by the configuration of the system components, as far as technically possible.","Access to the non-production environment requires two-factor or multi-factor authentication.

Cryptography and Key Management (CRY),CRY-02,Encryption of data for transmission (transport encryption),The Cloud Service Provider has established procedures and technical measures for strong encryption and authentication for the transmission of data of cloud customers over public networks.,The Cloud Service Provider has established procedures and technical measures for strong encryption and authentication for the transmission of all data.,"When transmitting data with normal protection requirements within the Cloud Service Provider’s infrastructure, encryption is not mandatory provided that the data is not transmitted via public networks. In this case, the non-public environment of the Cloud Service Provider can generally be deemed trusted. The protocols TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are currently regarded as strong, state-of-the-art transport encryptions, in each case in combination with Perfect Forward Secrecy. The specific configuration should comply with the recommendations of the (current) version of the BSI Technical Guideline TR-02102-2 ""Cryptographic Procedures: Recommendations and key lengths. Part 2 - Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS)"". Generally, the use of wildcard certificates is not considered a secure procedure.

If the Cloud Service Provider established a procedure to use a master key, the Cloud Service Provider must perform sample-based checks regarding the suitability and effectiveness of the procedure, on a regular basis. This criterion does not apply to data that cannot be encrypted for the provision of the cloud service for functional reasons.","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls for those parts of the cloud service under their responsibility (e. g. virtual machines within an IaaS solution), that their data is encrypted during storage in accordance with the respective protection requirements.",partially,"The encryption of data of cloud customers is configured centrally; therefore, it is only suitable for continuous auditing to a limited extent. Exceptions to the encryption of data according to a specified procedure and the coordination of this with cloud customers should be documented and approved. This, too, is only suitable to a limited extent for continuous auditing, as these exceptions are decided on a case-by-case basis and do not occur at a high enough frequency. In a continuous audit, the system status can be queried to determine whether the encryption is active and whether the approved exceptions are being adhered to."
Cryptography and Key Management (CRY),CRY-04,Secure key management,"Procedures and technical safeguards for secure key management in the area of responsibility of the Cloud Service Provider include at least the following aspects:

- which communication relationships and which network and application protocols are permitted in each case;

- how the data traffic for administration and monitoring is segregated from each on network level;

- which internal, cross-location communication is permitted and;

- which cross-network communication is allowed",,"Cross-location communication can be realised for e.g. individual regions or data centres via e.g. WAN, LAN, VPN, RAS. ",,no,The required security requirements are centrally documented and rarely changed. Continuous auditing is not practical.
Communication Security (COS),COS-03,Monitoring of connections in the Cloud Service Provider's network,"A distinction is made between trusted and untrusted networks. Based on a risk assessment, these are separated into different security zones for internal and external network areas (and DMZ, if applicable). Physical and virtualised network environments are designed and configured to restrict and monitor the established connection to trusted or untrusted networks according to the defined security requirements.

The entirety of the conception and configuration undertaken to monitor the connections mentioned is assessed in a risk-oriented manner, at least annually, with regard to the resulting security requirements.

Identified vulnerabilities and deviations are subject to risk assessment in accordance with the risk management procedure (cf. OIS-06) and follow-up measures are defined and tracked (cf. OPS-18).

At specified intervals, the business justification for using all services, protocols, and ports is reviewed. The review also includes the justifications for compensatory measures for the use of protocols that are considered insecure.",,"The review of the security requirements depends on the measures implemented to design the networks. For example, monitoring and reviewing firewall rules or log files for abnormalities, as well as visual inspections of physical network components for changes.","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the virtual networks within the cloud service for which they are responsible are designed, configured and documented in accordance with their network security requirements (e.g. logical segmentation of the cloud customer's organisational units).",yes,"If the business justification and the regular review of the monitoring concept are documented in a standardised way, these processes can be evaluated automatically. Thus, a continuous audit can be conducted. The separation of the networks is suitable for continuous auditing as well, since the status of the separation can be continuously audited here."
Communication Security (COS),COS-04,Cross-network access,Each network perimeter is controlled by security gateways. The system access authorisation for cross-network access is based on a security assessment based on the requirements of the cloud customers.,Each network perimeter is controlled by redundant and highly-available security gateways.,Cross-network access is access from one network to another network via a defined network perimeter.,Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that access is controlled according to their protection needs by security gateways on the perimeters of the virtual networks within the cloud service for which they are responsible.,yes,"If the control of the network perimeters is documented (e.g. by logs), these logs can be evaluated automatically. This offers the possibility of a continuous audit for this part of the criterion. If the security evaluation for access authorisations is carried out in a standardised form at the Cloud Service Provider, this can also be evaluated automatically. In this case, a continuous audit for the second part of the criterion would also be possible."
Communication Security (COS),COS-05,Networks for administration,There are separate networks for the administrative management of the infrastructure and for the operation of management consoles. These networks are logically or physically separated from the cloud customer's network and protected from unauthorised access by multi-factor authentication (cf. IDM-09). Networks used by the Cloud Service Provider to migrate or create virtual machines are also physically or logically separated from other networks,,,,no,"A continuous audit is not practical since infrastructure components and the logical and physical separation of the networks are implemented initially and a continuous audit of these components may require a system status, but it is difficult to test all aspects continuously."
Communication Security (COS),COS-06,Segregation of data traffic in jointly used network environments,Data traffic of cloud customers in jointly used network environments is segregated on network level according to a documented concept to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted.,"In the case of IaaS/PaaS, the secure segregation is ensured by physically separated networks or by means of strongly encrypted VLANs. For the definition of strong encryption, the BSI Technical Guideline TR-02102 must be considered.","If the suitability and effectiveness of the logical segmentation cannot be assessed with sufficient certainty (e.g. due to a complex implementation), evidence can also be provided based on audit results of expert third parties (e.g. security audits to validate the concept). The segregation of stored and processed data is subject of the criterion OPS-24. After successful authentication via an insecure communication channel (HTTP), a secure communication channel (HTTPS) is to be used. 

With IaaS/PaaS, secure segregation is ensured by physically separated networks or strong encryption of the networks. For the definition of strong encryption, the BSI Technical Guideline TR-02102 must be considered (cf. CRY-01). 

If the Cloud Service Provider does not use shared network environments for cloud customers and instead uses a physical segregation, the basic criterion is not applicable.","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls for those parts of the cloud service under their responsibility that virtual networks are designed, configured and documented in accordance with their network security requirements (e.g. logical segmentation of organizational units).",no,"The logical segregation of cloud customer network traffic at the network level is centrally configured and rarely changed.

Portability and Interoperability (PI),PI-02,Contractual agreements for the provision of data,"In contractual agreements, the following aspects are defined with regard to the termination of the contractual relationship, insofar as these are applicable to the cloud service:

- Type, scope and format of the data the Cloud Service Provider provides to the cloud customer;

- Definition of the timeframe, within which the Cloud Service Provider makes the data available to the cloud customer 

- Definition of the point in time as of which the Cloud Service Provider makes the data inaccessible to the cloud customer and deletes these; and

- The cloud customers' responsibilities and obligations to cooperate for the provision of the data.

The definitions are based on the needs of subject matter experts of potential customers who assess the suitability of the cloud service with regard to a dependency on the Cloud Service Provider as well as legal and regulatory requirements.","The design of the aspects is based on legal and regulatory requirements in the environment of the Cloud Service Provider. The Cloud Service Provider identifies the requirements regularly, at least once a year, and checks these for actuality and adjusts the contractual agreements accordingly.","The type and scope of the data and the responsibilities for its provision depend on the service model of the cloud service or the services and functions provided:

In the case of IaaS and PaaS, the cloud customer is generally responsible for extracting and backing up the data which is stored in the cloud service before termination of the contractual relationship (cf. complementary requirement).

The Cloud Service Provider's responsibility is typically limited to the provision of data for the configuration of the infrastructure or platform that the cloud customer has set up within its environment (e.g. configuration of networks, images of virtual machines and containers).

With SaaS, the cloud customer typically relies on export functions provided by the Cloud Service Provider. Data created by the cloud customer should be available in the same format as stored in the cloud service. Other data, including relevant log files and metadata, should be available in an applicable standard format, such as CSV, JSON or XML.

In Germany, legal requirements for retention can be found, for example, in the German Tax Code (§147 AO) and the German Commercial Code (§257 HGB). These provide for a retention obligation of six or ten years.",Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the data to which they are contractually entitled is requested from the Cloud Service Provider at the end of the contract or accessed via defined interfaces (the type and scope of the data correspond to the contractual agreements that were concluded prior to the use of the cloud service) and that it is stored in accordance with the legal requirements applicable to this data.,no,"The Cloud Service Provider should have a standardised template for its contracts.

The frequency of the monitoring corresponds to the classification of the third party based on the risk assessment conducted by the Cloud Service Provider (cf. SSO-02). The results of the monitoring are included in the review of the third party's risk assessment.

Identified violations and deviations are subjected to analysis, evaluation and treatment in accordance with the risk management procedure (cf. OIS-07).","The procedures for monitoring compliance with the requirements are supplemented by automatic procedures relating to the following aspects:

- Configuration of system components;

- The scope and the validity respectively the period covered by the evidence;

- For attestation reports: Qualifications of the opinion, included deviations/other observations including management's response and corresponding controls to be implemented and executed by the Cloud Service Provider;

- Disclosed subcontractors incl. any changes among those (e.g. additional subcontractor); and

- Stated security incidents.",Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that they stay informed about subservice organisations of their Cloud Service Provider (e.g. on the basis of the information in the C5 attestation report) and decide on the basis of their need for protection of their data processed and stored in the cloud service whether further action should be taken to monitor and check these subservice organisations.,partially,"A continuous audit of some of the required evidence, such as the reviews conducted and their results, can be performed once the Cloud Service Provider documents the associated steps using a tool.

Control and Monitoring of Service Providers and Suppliers (SSO),SSO-05,Exit strategy for the receipt of benefits,"The Cloud Service Provider has defined and documented exit strategies for the purchase of services where the risk assessment of the service providers and suppliers regarding the scope, complexity and uniqueness of the purchased service resulted in a very high dependency (cf. Supplementary Information).

Exit strategies are aligned with operational continuity plans and include the following aspects:

- Analysis of the potential costs, impacts, resources and timing of the transition of a purchased service to an alternative service provider or supplier;

- Definition and allocation of roles, responsibilities and sufficient resources to perform the activities for a transition;

- Definition of success criteria for the transition; and

- Definition of indicators for monitoring the performance of services, which should initiate the withdrawal from the service if the results are unacceptable.",,"A very high dependency can be assumed in the following situations in particular:

- The purchased service is absolutely required for the provision of the cloud service – this situation is given when the Cloud Service Provider:

    - provides the cloud service from data centres operated by third parties; and

    - provides a SaaS service and uses the IaaS or PaaS of another Cloud Service Provider.

- The service cannot be obtained within one month from an alternative service provider or supplier, as: 

    - It is unique on the market and no other supplier can deliver it;

    - It is strongly individualised by the service provider or supplier and/or the Cloud Service Provider;

    - It cannot be supplied by any other provider in the required quality of service; and

    - It requires specific knowledge that is only/mainly available to the current service provider or supplier and not to the Cloud Service Provider.",,no,The existence of individual exit strategies is not a practical test item for continuous audit.
Security Incident Management (SIM),SIM-01,Policy for security incident management,"Policies and instructions with technical and organisational safeguards are documented, communicated and provided in accordance with SP-01 to ensure a fast, effective and proper response to all known security incidents.

The Cloud Service Provider defines guidelines for the classification, prioritisation and escalation of security incidents and creates interfaces to the incident management and business continuity management.

In addition, the Cloud Service Provider has set up a ""Computer Emergency Response Team"" (CERT), which contributes to the coordinated resolution of occurring security incidents.

Customers affected by security incidents are informed in a timely and appropriate manner.","There are instructions as to how the data of a suspicious system can be collected in a conclusive manner in the event of a security incident. In addition, there are analysis plans for typical security incidents and an evaluation methodology so that the collected information does not lose its evidential value in any subsequent legal assessment.",,Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that they receive notifications from the Cloud Service Provider about security incidents that affect them and that these notifications are forwarded in a timely manner to the responsible departments for handling so that an appropriate response can be triggered,partially,"A continuous audit of the documented policies and instructions is not effective because they are not subject to high frequency changes. Thus, the audit of the policies and instructions can be performed in the recurring audit.

Similarly, setting up a CERT is not suitable for continuous auditing as it is an organisational body and does not require continuous monitoring.

The timely communication of security incidents to affected customers can be covered by a continuous audit approach. In addition, the Cloud Service Provider can document not only the security incidents by means of logs, but also that they have been communicated to the customer via e-mail, for example. The fact that there was communication to affected customers for every security incident can thus be evaluated automatically and continuously by the auditor. 

However, this procedure can be combined with the audit approach of further requirements of Security Incident Management."
Security Incident Management (SIM),SIM-02,Processing of security incidents,"Subject matter experts of the Cloud Service Provider, together with external security providers where appropriate, classify, prioritise and perform root-cause analyses for events that could constitute a security incident.","The Cloud Service Provider simulates the identification, analysis and defence of security incidents and attacks at least once a year through appropriate tests and exercises (e.g. Red Team training).",,,yes,"The Cloud Service Provider documents all security incidents in digital form, which contains information about the classification, prioritisation and root cause analysis of the incidents. The root cause analysis should be standardised to facilitate continuous auditing.

An automatic and continuous evaluation of these security incidents can then be carried out by the auditor by excluding the logs or tickets produced and testing whether the security incident has been classified and prioritised and whether these steps have been carried out based on a standardised root cause analysis.

Security Incident Management (SIM),SIM-03,Documentation and reporting of security incidents,"After a security incident has been processed, the solution is documented in accordance with the contractual agreements and the report is sent to the affected customers for final acknowledgement or, if applicable, as confirmation.","The customer can either actively approve solutions or the solution is automatically approved after a certain period.

Information on security incidents or confirmed security breaches is made available to all affected customers.

The contract between the Cloud Service Provider and the cloud customer regulates which data is made available to the cloud customer for his own analysis in the event of security incidents.",,Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that they receive notifications from the Cloud Service Provider about security incident that affect them and their resolution and that these notifications are forwarded promptly to the entity responsible for handling them so that an appropriate response can be made.,yes,"In the logs or tickets that document the security incidents (Cf. SIM-03), the Cloud Service Provider also describes the solution pursued to eliminate the incident. In addition, the Cloud Service Provider also documents the confirmation to the customer.

The auditor can then automatically and continuously read out whether the documented security incidents have been resolved and whether a solution has been documented. The same applies to the communication of the resolution of the incidents to affected customers. If this is not the case, the unresolved security incident can be documented as the output value of the continuous audit."
Security Incident Management (SIM),SIM-04,Duty of the users to report security incidents to a central body,"The Cloud Service Provider informs employees and external business partners of their obligations. If necessary, they agree to or are contractually obliged to report all security events that become known to them and are directly related to the cloud service provided by the Cloud Service Provider to a previously designated central office of the Cloud Service Provider promptly.

In addition, the Cloud Service Provider communicates that ""false reports"" of events that do not subsequently turn out to be incidents do not have any negative consequences.",,,"Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that identified security events, which the Cloud Service Provider is required to process, are communicated promptly to previously designated, responsible personnel.

The identification of such security events is supported by suitable controls (cf. complementary criterion for OPS-10).",partially,"The Cloud Service Provider should inform its employees and external business partners about their obligations in a standardised and digital format. This obligation usually occurs when the employee joins the company or the business relationship.

This enables the auditor to automatically and continuously audit whether all employees and external business partners are notified of their obligations by automatically testing whether the clause, if any, is included in the contract when the contract is signed."
Security Incident Management (SIM),SIM-05,Evaluation and learning process,Mechanisms are in place to measure and monitor the type and scope of security incidents and to report them to support agencies. The information obtained from the evaluation is used to identify recurrent or significant incidents and to identify the need for further protection.,,Supporting bodies may be external service providers or government agencies such as the BSI.,Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that they include into their ISMS the findings and measures related to previous security incidents reported by the Cloud Service Provider. The cloud customers evaluate whether and which supporting measures they might take on their side.,no,"The existing mechanisms for measuring the type and scope of security incidents are rarely changed. As a result, continuous auditing is not effective.

- Simulation of scenarios; and

- Emergency or full exercise.

After a completed exercise:

- Review and possible adaptation of the existing alarm plan.
Relevant third parties are in particular service providers and suppliers of the Cloud Service Provider who contribute to the provision of the cloud service (cf. basic criteria SSO-02 and SSO-05).","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that measures to prevent the impact of a cloud service or Cloud Service Provider outage are regularly reviewed, updated, tested and exercised. The Cloud Service Provider is involved in the tests and exercises in accordance with the contractual agreements.

Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the results of the Cloud Service Provider's BCM tests and exercises are incorporated into their own BCM and that they are fully appreciated with regard to ensuring the customer's operational continuity.

In tests and exercises that involve the customer and therefore require own measures on the customer side, cloud customers ensure that the appropriate measures for coping with the scenario are practiced and tested by means of suitable BCM controls.",partially,"Implementing the tests of the operational continuity plans in an annual cycle does not make a continuous audit of the entire criterion effective. The effort for both Cloud Service Providers and auditors to automate and continuously test this process would be higher than the results.

However, it is possible to continuously audit whether a test was carried out within the required time span. To do this, the Cloud Service Provider must document in a standardised manner that and when a test was carried out."
Compliance (COM),COM-01,"Identification of applicable legal, regulatory, self-imposed or contractual requirements","The legal, regulatory, self-imposed and contractual requirements relevant to the information security of the cloud service as well as the Cloud Service Provider's procedures for complying with these requirements are explicitly defined and documented.",,"The Cloud Service Provider's documentation may refer to the following requirements, among others:

- Requirements for the protection of personal data (e.g. EU General Data Protection Regulation);

- Compliance requirements based on contractual obligations with cloud customers (e.g. ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS);

- generally accepted accounting principles (e.g. in accordance with HGB or IFRS);

- Requirements regarding access to data and auditability of digital documents (e.g. according to GDPdU); and

- Other laws (e.g. according to BSIG or AktG).",,no,"A continuous audit of contract specifications, regulations and their documentation does not seem to be effective. In this case, the test within the recurring audit is sufficient.

A continuous audit could assist in giving the date of the last audit of the criteria."
Compliance (COM),COM-02,Policy for planning and conducting audits,"Policies and instructions for planning and conducting audits are documented, communicated and made available in accordance with SP-01 and address the following aspects:

- Restriction to read-only access to system components in accordance with the agreed audit plan and as necessary to perform the activities;

- Activities that may result in malfunctions to the cloud service or breaches of contractual requirements are performed during scheduled maintenance windows or outside peak periods; and

- Logging and monitoring of activities.",The Cloud Service Provider grants its cloud customers contractually guaranteed information and audit rights.,,"Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that appropriate responses are made to malfunctions to the cloud service through such audits.

To the extent that contractually guaranteed information and audit rights exist, the cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that these rights are designed and executed in accordance with their own requirements.",partially,"A policy can change ad-hoc. However, the continuous audit of policies is only partially feasible as the only attributes that can be tested are the last change date and the status of review or approval, as far as this information is stored in a system. The content of a policy can hardly be tested automatically."
Compliance (COM),COM-03,Internal audits of the information security management system,"Subject matter experts check the compliance of the information security management system at regular intervals, at least annually, with the relevant and applicable legal, regulatory, self-imposed or contractual requirements (cf. COM-01) as well as compliance with the policies and instructions (cf. SP-01) within their scope of responsibility (cf. OIS-01) through internal audits (cf. § 9.2 of ISO/IEC 27001).

Identified vulnerabilities and deviations are subject to risk assessment in accordance with the risk management procedure (cf. OIS-06) and follow-up measures are defined and tracked (cf. OPS-18).","Internal audits are supplemented by procedures to automatically monitor applicable requirements of policies and instructions with regard to the following aspects:

- Configuration of system components to provide the cloud service within the Cloud Service Provider's area of responsibility;

- Performance and availability of these system components;

- Response time to malfunctions and security incidents;

- Recovery time (time to completion of error handling);

Identified vulnerabilities and deviations are automatically reported to the appropriate Cloud Service Provider’s subject matter experts for immediate assessment and action.
 
Cloud customers can view compliance with selected contractual requirements in real time.","Subject matter experts operate, e.g., in the Cloud Service Provider's internal revision department or expert third parties commissioned by the Cloud Service Provider, such as auditing companies, and may hold relevant certifications such as ""Certified Internal Auditor (CIA)"". 

With regard to ISMS compliance, see Section 9.2 of ISO/IEC 27001.",,yes,"The regular performance of an internal audit of the ISMS can be set up as part of compliance monitoring. For this purpose, the results of the internal audit must be digitally documented, as well as the individual audit steps.

A continuous audit of this internal audit is not effective but can only be considered after compliance monitoring has been set up. 

The continuous audit can then supply the date of the last audit as the output value."
Compliance (COM),COM-04,Information on information security performance and management assessment of the ISMS,"The top management of the Cloud Service Provider is regularly informed about the information security performance within the scope of the ISMS in order to ensure its continued suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The information is included in the management review of the ISMS at is performed at least once a year.",,"The top management is a natural person or group of people who make final decisions for the institution and are responsible for these.

The aspects to be dealt with in the management review of the ISMS are listed in Section 9.3 of ISO / IEC 27001.",,partially,"The actual transmission of information to the Cloud Service Provider's management can be logged and automated. However, the testing of the contents of the communication and the that these have also been included in the management assessment must still be carried out within the regular audit."
Dealing with investigation requests from government agencies (INQ),INQ-01,Legal Assessment of Investigative Inquiries,Investigation requests from government agencies are subjected to a legal assessment by subject matter experts of the Cloud Service Provider. The assessment determines whether the government agency has an applicable and legally valid legal basis and what further steps need to be taken.,,,Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the type and scope of government investigation requests and the associated disclosure of their own data has been dealt with in their own risk management and that the use of the cloud service only takes place when this risk has been deemed acceptable.,no,"Although a continuous audit of the performance of the assessment and its documentation is conceivable, a continuous audit is not practical. Rather the criterion aims at the qualification of the auditing personnel as well as the process behind it, which is both subject to manual audit."
Dealing with investigation requests from government agencies (INQ),INQ-02,Informing Cloud Customers about Investigation Requests,"The Cloud Service Provider informs the affected Cloud Customer(s) without undue delay, unless the applicable legal basis on which the government agency is based prohibits this or there are clear indications of illegal actions in connection with the use of the Cloud Service.",,This does not affect other legal or regulatory requirements that requires earlier information for cloud customers.,Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that such notifications are received and legally checked according to their own specifications and possibilities.,partially,"For internal process monitoring at the Cloud Service Provider and facilitation of the audit, a continuous audit of the period between receipt of the request and information of the customers is conceivable.

However, as this depends on local legal basis, the effort to establish this in the respective regions will be quite high.

If a transaction processing system is implemented at the Cloud Service Provider, at least the process in this system can be continuously audited."
Dealing with investigation requests from government agencies (INQ),INQ-03,Conditions for Access to or Disclosure of Data in Investigation Requests,Access to or disclosure of cloud customer data in connection with government investigation requests is subject to the proviso that the Cloud Service Provider's legal assessment has shown that an applicable and valid legal basis exists and that the investigation request must be granted on that basis.,,,,yes,"To the extent that a separate role is assigned to the investigator in order to gain access to the data, the prerequisites specified in the request can be entered and checked by the system and linked to the assignment of the investigator role.

A continuous query can then be made to ensure that the role was only granted if the prerequisites defined by the system were fulfilled. Deviations can be audited manually."
Dealing with investigation requests from government agencies (INQ),INQ-04,Limiting Access to or Disclosure of Data in Investigation Requests,"The Cloud Service Provider's procedures establishing access to or disclosing data of cloud customers in the context of investigation requests from governmental agencies ensure that the agencies only gain access to or insight into the data that is the subject of the investigation request.

If no clear limitation of the data is possible, the Cloud Service Provider anonymises or pseudonymises the data so that government agencies can only assign it to those cloud customers who are subject of the investigation request.",,,,partially,"A separate role for the investigator is to be provided (cf. also INQ-03). It is conceivable that certain data types for this role may not be visible, pseudonymised or anonymised, or that data of customers that are not part of the investigation may be excluded. 

However, this requires a manual effort in the configuration and assignment of the investigator role.

Under these conditions, however, a continuous audit of whether and to what extent the investigator had access to data is conceivable."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-01,Guidelines and Recommendations for Cloud Customers,"The Cloud Service Provider provides cloud customers with guidelines and recommendations for the secure use of the cloud service provided. The information contained therein is intended to assist the cloud customer in the secure configuration, installation and use of the cloud service, to the extent applicable to the cloud service and the responsibility of the cloud user.

The type and scope of the information provided will be based on the needs of subject matter experts of the cloud customers who set information security requirements, implement them or verify the implementation (e.g. IT, Compliance, Internal Audit). The information in the guidelines and recommendations for the secure use of the cloud service address the following aspects, where applicable to the cloud service:

- Instructions for secure configuration;

- Information sources on known vulnerabilities and update mechanisms;

- Error handling and logging mechanisms;

- Authentication mechanisms;

- Roles and rights concept including combinations that result in an 
elevated risk; and

- Services and functions for administration of the cloud service by privileged users. 

The information is maintained so that it is applicable to the cloud service provided in the version intended for productive use.",,,"Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the Cloud Service Provider's information is used to derive policies, concepts and measures for the secure configuration and use (according to their own risk assessment) of the cloud service. Compliance with these policies, concepts and measures is checked. Changes to the information are promptly assessed for their impact on these documents and any necessary changes are implemented.",partially,"The provision of information from the Cloud Service Provider to cloud customers can only be audited continuously to a limited extent. For example, the Cloud Service Provider can make the guidelines and recommendations available via its internal customer portal, which makes a continuous audit only partially effective.

Here, only an audit for completeness and the last modification date is conceivable, although a discussion of the content of the changes is not effective. For this, a semantic evaluation would be necessary."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-02,Identification of Vulnerabilities of the Cloud Service,"The Cloud Service Provider applies appropriate measures to check the cloud service for vulnerabilities which might have been integrated into the cloud service during the software development process.

The procedures for identifying such vulnerabilities are part of the software development process and, depending on a risk assessment, include the following activities:

- Static Application Security Testing;

- Dynamic Application Security Testing;

- Code reviews by the Cloud Service Provider's subject matter experts; and

- Obtaining information about confirmed vulnerabilities in software libraries provided by third parties and used in their own cloud service.

The severity of identified vulnerabilities is assessed according to defined criteria and measures are taken to immediately eliminate or mitigate them.",The procedures for identifying such vulnerabilities also include annual code reviews or security penetration tests by qualified external third parties.,"Known vulnerabilities in externally related system components (e.g. operating systems) used for the development and provision of the cloud service but not going through the Cloud Service Provider's software development process are the subject of criteria OPS-23 (Management of vulnerabilities, malfunctions and errors - open vulnerability assessment).",,yes,"The Cloud Service Provider automatically checks its cloud services for vulnerabilities. This check is documented in a standardised digital form.

By auditing this documentation, the auditor verifies, whether the Cloud Service Provider has performed a vulnerability scan. In addition, the severity of the identified vulnerabilities can be integrated into this continuous audit if the defined criteria and their application are standardised and machine-readable.

The information on identified and/or repaired vulnerabilities can also be transferred directly to the affected customer and thus increased transparency can be achieved."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-03,Online Register of Known Vulnerabilities,"The Cloud Service Provider operates or refers to a daily updated online register of known vulnerabilities that affect the Cloud Service Provider and assets provided by the Cloud Service Provider that the cloud customers have to install, provide or operate themselves under the customers responsibility.

The presentation of the vulnerabilities follows the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

The online register is easily accessible to any cloud customer. The information contained therein forms a suitable basis for risk assessment and possible follow-up measures on the part of cloud users. 

For each vulnerability, it is indicated whether software updates (e.g. patch, update) are available, when they will be rolled out and whether they will be deployed by the Cloud Service Provider, the cloud customer or both of them together.","Assets provided by the Cloud Service Provider, which must be installed, provided or operated by cloud users within their area of responsibility, are equipped with automatic update mechanisms. After approval by the respective cloud user, software updates can be rolled out in such a way that they can be distributed to all affected users without human interaction.","Assets provided by the Cloud Service Provider that cloud customers have to install, deploy or operate themselves in their area of responsibility are for example local software clients and apps as well as tools for integrating the cloud service.

If the cloud service relies on other cloud services, this registry has to incorporate or refer to the vulnerabilities of those other cloud services in order for this criterion to be met.","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the information in this register is incorporated sufficiently quickly into their own risk management, evaluated and, if necessary, taken into account in their own area of responsibility.",yes,"A continuous audit includes, above all, whether the information is updated daily. The distribution of software updates must be documented by the Cloud Service Provider (logs). This documentation can then be automatically and continuously evaluated by the auditor to ensure that the software used on assets in the cloud users' area of responsibility is up-to-date."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-04,Error handling and Logging Mechanisms,"The cloud service provided is equipped with error handling and logging mechanisms. These enable cloud users to obtain security-related information about the security status of the cloud service as well as the data, services or functions it provides.

The information is detailed enough to allow cloud users to check the following aspects, insofar as they are applicable to the cloud service:

- Which data, services or functions available to the cloud user within the cloud service, have been accessed by whom and when (Audit Logs);

- Malfunctions during processing of automatic or manual actions; and

- Changes to security-relevant configuration parameters, error handling and logging mechanisms, user authentication, action authorisation, cryptography, and communication security.

The logged information is protected from unauthorised access and modification and can be deleted by the Cloud Customer.

If the cloud customer is responsible for the activation or type and scope of logging, the Cloud Service Provider must provide appropriate logging capabilities.",Cloud users can retrieve security-related information via documented interfaces which are suitable for further processing this information as part of their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).,"In the case of a SaaS service for secure data exchange, the terms data, services or functions would mean, for example, the logging of all read or write accesses to the stored files and their metadata.","If the cloud service is equipped with error handling and logging mechanisms, cloud customers must activate these and configure them according to defined requirements. The cloud customer must incorporate his own information security management for this purpose.",yes,"The information about the security status of cloud services and further data provided can be read automatically and continuously, as these must be made available to cloud users in digital form. 

This enables continuous auditing."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-05,Authentication Mechanisms,"The Cloud Service Provider provides authentication mechanisms that can force strong authentication (e.g. two or more factors) for users, IT components or applications within the cloud users' area of responsibility.
These authentication mechanisms are set up at all access points that allow users, IT components or applications to interact with the cloud service. 

For privileged users, IT components or applications, these authentication mechanisms are enforced.","The cloud service offers out-of-band authentication (OOB), in which the factors are transmitted via different channels (e.g. Internet and mobile network).","IT components in the sense of this criterion are independently usable objects with external interfaces that can be connected with other IT components.

Access points in the sense of this criterion are those that can be accessed by users, IT components or applications via networks (for users, for example, the login screen on the publicly accessible website of the Cloud Service Provider).

Multi-factor authentication can be performed with cryptographic certificates, smart cards or tokens, for example.",Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that the authentication mechanisms offered by the cloud service are used in accordance with the customer's identity and authorisation management requirements.,partially,"The implementation of authentication mechanisms for users takes place via configurations that are only adapted at a low frequency. Thus, continuous auditing is only partially effective here.

Nevertheless, it is conceivable to monitor the status of the underlying authentication system, but only deviations from target configurations can be checked. Whether these deviations are desired or not must still be recorded in a manual audit."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-06,Session Management,"To protect confidentiality, availability, integrity and authenticity during interactions with the cloud service, a suitable session management system is used that at least corresponds to the state-of-the-art and is protected against known attacks. Mechanisms are implemented that invalidate a session after it has been detected as inactive. The inactivity can be detected by time measurement. In this case, the time interval can be configured by the Cloud Service Provider or - if technically possible - by the cloud customer.",,"Known attacks include manipulation, forgery, session takeover, denial of service attacks, enveloping, replay and null cipher attacks.",Cloud customers can use appropriate controls to ensure that they are using the session management protection features of the cloud service in accordance with their own ISMS. They also set the time period after which a session becomes invalid according to their own ISMS specifications.,partially,"The use of Session Management is controlled by configurations. These configurations are changed or adapted at a low frequency, so continuous auditing is only partially effective.

Nevertheless, monitoring the status of the underlying authentication system is conceivable, but only deviations from target configurations can be checked. Whether these deviations are normal must still be tested in a manual audit."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-07,Confidentiality of Authentication Information,"If passwords are used as authentication information for the cloud service, their confidentiality is ensured by the following procedures:

- Users can initially create the password themselves or must change an initial password when logging in to the cloud service for the first time. An initial password loses its validity after a maximum of 14 days.

- When creating passwords, compliance with the length and complexity requirements of the Cloud Service Provider (cf. IDM-09) or the cloud customer is technically enforced.

- The user is informed about changing or resetting the password.

- The server-side storage takes place using state-of-the-art cryptographically strong hash functions in combination with at least 32-bit long salt values.",,"The state-of-the-art regarding cryptographically strong hash functions is described in the current version of the BSI Technical Guideline TR-02102-1 ""Cryptographic mechanisms: Recommendations and key lengths"". In version 2019-01 of this guideline these were:

- SHA-256, SHA-512/256, SHA-384, SHA-512; and

- SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512.",Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that they use sufficiently secure passwords (cf. IDM-09) according to their own assessment and that the risks of unauthorised access associated with their own choice are borne.,no,Compliance with security policies for password assignment is configured centrally and adjusted at a low frequency. A continuous audit is therefore only of limited use.
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-08,Roles and Rights Concept,"The Cloud Service Provider provides cloud users with a roles and rights concept for managing access rights. It describes rights profiles for the functions provided by the cloud service.

The rights profiles are suitable for enabling cloud users to manage access authorisations and permissions in accordance with the principle of least-privilege and how it is necessary for the performance of tasks (""need-to-know principle"") and to implement the principle of functional separation between operational and controlling functions (""separation of duties"").",,"In IaaS, a role and rights concept would describe, among other things, the rights profiles for the following functions of the cloud service:

- Administration of the states of virtual machines (start, 
pause, stop) as well as for their migration or monitoring;

- Management of available images that can be used to create virtual machines; and

- Management of virtual networks (e.g. configuration of virtual routers and switches).","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that:

- the granting of permissions to users in their area of responsibility is subject to authorisation; and

- the appropriateness of the assigned authorisations is regularly reviewed and authorisations are adjusted or withdrawn in a timely manner in the event of necessary changes (e.g. employee resignation).",partially,"The existence of a roles and rights concept in the form of a configuration in the system can be monitored. However, it should be noted that, regarding the content of this concept, only deviations from target configurations can be checked. Whether these deviations are desired or not must still be recorded in a manual audit."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-09,Authorisation Mechanisms,"Access to the functions provided by the cloud service is restricted by access controls (authorisation mechanisms) that verify whether users, IT components, or applications are authorised to perform certain actions.

The Cloud Service Provider validates the functionality of the authorisation mechanisms before new functions are made available to cloud users and in the event of changes to the authorisation mechanisms of existing functions (cf. DEV-06). The severity of identified vulnerabilities is assessed according to defined criteria based on industry standard metrics (e.g. Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and measures for timely resolution or mitigation are initiated. Vulnerabilities that have not been fixed are listed in the online register of known vulnerabilities (cf. PSS-02).","Access controls are attribute-based to enable granular and contextual checks against multiple attributes of a user, IT component, or application (e.g., role, location, authentication method).",,,yes,"The changes to authorisation mechanisms and the identification of vulnerabilities are documented in a standardised manner by the Cloud Service Provider. This documentation can be automated and continuously audited. If the elimination of the vulnerabilities and their prioritisation also takes place in a standardised form (according to standardised criteria), these points can be integrated into the continuous audit."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-10,Software Defined Networking,"If the Cloud Service offers functions for software-defined networking (SDN), the confidentiality of the data of the cloud user is ensured by suitable SDN procedures.

The Cloud Service Provider validates the functionality of the SDN functions before providing new SDN features to cloud users or modifying existing SDN features. Identified defects are assessed and corrected in a risk-oriented manner.",,"This criterion is typically not applicable to the SaaS service model.

Suitable SDN methods for increasing confidentiality are, for example, L2 overlay networking (tagging) or tunnelling/encapsulation.",,yes,"Validation during provision and modification of SDN functions and identification of defects can be documented in a standardised manner by the Cloud Service Provider.

This documentation can be audited continuously and automatically by the auditor.

The ""marking"" of the data is carried out by a configuration that has to be tested centrally. A continuous audit of all transmitted data packets would not be effective here. 

The status of the configuration can be continuously audited against a target value, a content evaluation must be carried out manually."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-11,Images for Virtual Machines and Containers,"If cloud customers operate virtual machines or containers with the cloud service, the Cloud Service Provider must ensure the following aspects:

- The cloud customer can restrict the selection of images of virtual machines or containers according to his specifications, so that users of this cloud customer can only launch the images or containers released according to these restrictions.

- If the Cloud Service Provider provides images of virtual machines or containers to the Cloud Customer, the Cloud Service Provider appropriately inform the Cloud Customer of the changes made to the previous version.

- In addition, these images provided by the Cloud Service Provider are hardened according to generally accepted industry standards.","At startup and runtime of virtual machine or container images, an integrity check is performed that detects image manipulations and reports them to the cloud customer.","This criterion is typically not applicable to the SaaS service model.

Generally accepted industry standards are, for example, the Security Configuration Benchmark of the Centre for Internet Security (CIS) or the corresponding modules in the BSI IT-Grundschutz-Kompendium.",Cloud customers use appropriate controls to ensure that the images of virtual machines or containers they operate with the cloud service comply with their information security management requirements and that the results of the integrity checks at startup and at runtime are processed according to these requirements.,partially,"These functions must be centrally audited at regular intervals, but not continuously. Therefore, it is sufficient to integrate this into the recurring audit.

With an agent system, it would be possible to continuously query the configurations of the individual virtual machines and thus compare them with the target image. This could also be set up on demand and thus become part of the control that takes over the integrity check."
Product Safety and Security (PSS),PSS-12,Locations of Data Processing and Storage,"The cloud customer is able to specify the locations (location/country) of the data processing and storage including data backups according to the contractually available options.

This must be ensured by the cloud architecture.",,"This criterion supplements the General Condition BC-01.

The cloud architecture must exist in such a way that it enables the technical design of the IT infrastructure to provide the cloud service in accordance with the data location specifications agreed with the customer.","Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that, when selecting service providers and configuring the cloud service, they are informed about the available data processing and storage locations and, if there is a choice between different locations, that they select those that meet their own requirements.

Depending on the use case and especially when using services of a Cloud Service Provider which is based in another country, cloud customers take the laws applicable to them into account when making their selection (e.g. when processing personal data; compliance with legal retention obligations for business documents, etc.).",yes,"A continuous survey of the location of the data and the country from which the service is provided can be carried out automatically by the Cloud Service Provider.

This information can then be made available to the customer, for example on his dashboard or on request."
