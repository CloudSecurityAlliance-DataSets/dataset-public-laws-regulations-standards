The severity of identified vulnerabilities is assessed according to defined criteria based on industry standard metrics (e.g. Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and measures for timely resolution or mitigation are initiated. Vulnerabilities that have not been fixed are listed in the online register of known vulnerabilities (cf. PSS-02).",
        "Additional Criteria": "Access controls are attribute-based to enable granular and contextual checks against multiple attributes of a user, IT component, or application (e.g., role, location, authentication method).",

        "Supplementary Information -\nComplementary Customer Criteria": "",
        "Supplementary Information -\nNotes on Continuous Auditing - Feasibility": "yes",
        "Supplementary Information -\nNotes on Continuous Auditing": "The changes to authorisation mechanisms and the identification of vulnerabilities are documented in a standardised manner by the Cloud Service Provider. This documentation can be automated and continuously audited. If the elimination of the vulnerabilities and their prioritisation also takes place in a standardised form (according to standardised criteria), these points can be integrated into the continuous audit."

        "Basic Criteria": "If the Cloud Service offers functions for software-defined networking (SDN), the confidentiality of the data of the cloud user is ensured by suitable SDN procedures.\n\nThe Cloud Service Provider validates the functionality of the SDN functions before providing new SDN features to cloud users or modifying existing SDN features. Identified defects are assessed and corrected in a risk-oriented manner.",
        "Additional Criteria": "",
        "Supplementary Information -\nAbout the Criteria": "This criterion is typically not applicable to the SaaS service model.\n\nSuitable SDN methods for increasing confidentiality are, for example, L2 overlay networking (tagging) or tunnelling/encapsulation.",

        "Supplementary Information -\nNotes on Continuous Auditing": "Validation during provision and modification of SDN functions and identification of defects can be documented in a standardised manner by the Cloud Service Provider.\n\nThis documentation can be audited continuously and automatically by the auditor.\n\nThe \"marking\" of the data is carried out by a configuration that has to be tested centrally. A continuous audit of all transmitted data packets would not be effective here. \n\nThe status of the configuration can be continuously audited against a target value, a content evaluation must be carried out manually."

        "Title": "Images for Virtual Machines and Containers",
        "Basic Criteria": "If cloud customers operate virtual machines or containers with the cloud service, the Cloud Service Provider must ensure the following aspects:\n\n- The cloud customer can restrict the selection of images of virtual machines or containers according to his specifications, so that users of this cloud customer can only launch the images or containers released according to these restrictions.\n\n- If the Cloud Service Provider provides images of virtual machines or containers to the Cloud Customer, the Cloud Service Provider appropriately inform the Cloud Customer of the changes made to the previous version.\n\n- In addition, these images provided by the Cloud Service Provider are hardened according to generally accepted industry standards.",
        "Additional Criteria": "At startup and runtime of virtual machine or container images, an integrity check is performed that detects image manipulations and reports them to the cloud customer.",
        "Supplementary Information -\nAbout the Criteria": "This criterion is typically not applicable to the SaaS service model.\n\nGenerally accepted industry standards are, for example, the Security Configuration Benchmark of the Centre for Internet Security (CIS) or the corresponding modules in the BSI IT-Grundschutz-Kompendium.",
        "Supplementary Information -\nComplementary Customer Criteria": "Cloud customers use appropriate controls to ensure that the images of virtual machines or containers they operate with the cloud service comply with their information security management requirements and that the results of the integrity checks at startup and at runtime are processed according to these requirements.",
        "Supplementary Information -\nNotes on Continuous Auditing - Feasibility": "partially",
        "Supplementary Information -\nNotes on Continuous Auditing": "These functions must be centrally audited at regular intervals, but not continuously. Therefore, it is sufficient to integrate this into the recurring audit.\n\nWith an agent system, it would be possible to continuously query the configurations of the individual virtual machines and thus compare them with the target image. This could also be set up on demand and thus become part of the control that takes over the integrity check."

        "Additional Criteria": "",
        "Supplementary Information -\nAbout the Criteria": "This criterion supplements the General Condition BC-01.\n\nThe cloud architecture must exist in such a way that it enables the technical design of the IT infrastructure to provide the cloud service in accordance with the data location specifications agreed with the customer.",
        "Supplementary Information -\nComplementary Customer Criteria": "Cloud customers ensure through suitable controls that, when selecting service providers and configuring the cloud service, they are informed about the available data processing and storage locations and, if there is a choice between different locations, that they select those that meet their own requirements.\n\nDepending on the use case and especially when using services of a Cloud Service Provider which is based in another country, cloud customers take the laws applicable to them into account when making their selection (e.g. when processing personal data; compliance with legal retention obligations for business documents, etc.).",
        "Supplementary Information -\nNotes on Continuous Auditing - Feasibility": "yes",
        "Supplementary Information -\nNotes on Continuous Auditing": "A continuous survey of the location of the data and the country from which the service is provided can be carried out automatically by the Cloud Service Provider.\n\nThis information can then be made available to the customer, for example on his dashboard or on request."
