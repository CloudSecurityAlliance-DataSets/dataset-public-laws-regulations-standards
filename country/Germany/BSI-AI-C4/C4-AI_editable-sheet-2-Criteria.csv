In line with PC-01 the principles of the Risk Management Policy (C5-OIS-06 and C5-OIS-07) must apply. Results are consolidated in threat scenarios. A documented description of a threat scenario contains at least:
- Details of the model architecture or machine learning algorithm that are vulnerable and concrete attack vectors against such threats;
- Characteristics of the data the attack vector operates on or with, such as structure or type;
- If available, references to the implementation of the attack vector or a concrete explanation on how to implement the attack vector and respective countermeasures.
The threat scenarios must incorporate actual security incidents according to RE-05. Identified threat scenarios are followed up in the risk exposure assessment in SR-02 and SR03.","The AI service provider should continuously (at least quarterly) investigate state-of-the-art research and methodologies in order to stay up to date to new threat scenarios and attacks. Relevant threats for this criterion are in particular those that can lead to:
- leakage or corruption of data or AI models;
- violation of the integrity, confidentiality or availability of the AI service;
- intentional misuse of functionality or malfunction of the AI service.
Threats related to AI model(s) include for instance adversarial examples, poisoning attacks, model stealing attacks, model backdoors and membership inference attacks.
Release logs or similar sources of information for software packages implementing adversarial examples, data poisoning attacks and privacy methods should be carefully investigated with regards to the feasibility and applicability."
Security & Robustness,SR-02,Risk Exposure Assessment,"A risk exposure assessment is carried out by formulating a threat model that specifies the conditions under which the AI model(s) in scope of the AI service can be attacked. In line with PC-01 the principles of the Risk Management Policy (C5-OIS-06 and C5-OIS-07) and Managing Vulnerabilities, Malfunctions and Errors (C5-OPS-19) must apply. The threat model includes at least following points:
- Threat scenarios derived from SR-01;
- Adversary's goals;
- Adversary's knowledge about the AI service;
- Adversarial capabilities.
Based on estimated impact and probability of occurrence, threat models are prioritized and assigned to risk owners who formally define and document which risks have to be mitigated.
The results of the risk exposure assessment are documented in accordance with PC-02.","Based on the mitigation decisions, subject matter experts implement concrete attacks and test the AI service against specific weaknesses as specified in SR-04 and SR-05, if applicable. The prioritization of the risks identified should be conducted according to a risk matrix taking into account the probability of occurrence and the impact of the threat.
Adversary's goals include targeted or untargeted misclassification, confidence reduction, membership inferences or tampering with training data.
Adversary's knowledge about the AI service can be white box, grey box or black box and can contain knowledge about data preprocessing such as filters.
Adversarial capabilities include perturbation domains, bounds of the adversary and computational resources."
Security & Robustness,SR-03,Regular Risk Exposure Assessment,"The Risk Exposure Assessment is re-evaluated at regular intervals (at least annually) or in case of events such as:
- Changes to the AI system that affect the operating principles;
- Newly identified threats according to SR-01.","Changes, which affect the operating principles of the AI system include:
- introducing new features;
- extending the applicability of the service for larger user groups;
- retraining according to PF-07."
Security & Robustness,SR-04,Testing Learning Pipeline Robustness,"Based on the mitigation decisions for specific threat models for the learning pipeline of the AI
model(s) within the scope of the AI service (e.g. based on data poisoning or data tampering through backdoors) derived from the risk exposure assessment in SR-02 and SR-03, the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service are tested by simulating attacks. These tests take into account the integrity of the relevant data sets and their impact on the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service. Threat models, attack vectors and identified vulnerabilities are followed up as specified in SR-06. Subject matter experts perform a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of data contributed by users on future changes to the AI service in order to measure the risks associated with the inclusion of user data into the learning pipeline. Data access management according to DM-02 is taken into consideration.","Known state-of-the-art vulnerabilities of the learning pipeline include following types of data poisoning attacks:
- Logic corruption;
- Data manipulation;
- Data injection.
Note: In contrast to DM-02 this criterion focuses on protection of data integrity against external threats, while DM-02 aims to protect the data used for development and operation."
Security & Robustness,SR-05,Testing Of Model Robustness,"Based on the mitigation decisions for concrete threat models for the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service (e.g. based on adversarial attacks or privacy attacks) derived from the risk exposure assessment in SR-02 and SR-03, the AI model(s) are tested by implementing attacks to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
Specifications of the implementation and configuration of the tested attacks are documented, including the results of the tests.
The attacks tested are documented including the observed system behavior of the AI service. Threat models, attack vectors and identified vulnerabilities are followed up as specified in SR-06.","Depending on the threat model, testing of the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service can include following types of adversarial attacks:
- White box attacks;
- Black box attacks;
- Adaptive attacks;
- Transferability attacks;
- Physical attacks;
- Targeted and untargeted attacks.
Furthermore, basic sanity checks should be performed (e.g. iterative attacks perform better than single-step attacks and use sufficient iterations to converge, considering computational time and respective results after convergence)."
Security & Robustness,SR-06,Implementation of Countermeasures,"Countermeasures to protect the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service and its learning pipeline against threats are implemented by the AI service provider based on the susceptibility to attacks investigated in SR-04 and SR-05 as well as in line with PC-01, following the principles of Handling Vulnerabilities and Malfunctions and Errors (C5-OPS18 and C5-OPS-20). The countermeasures are tested adequately for effectiveness regarding identified threat models as specified in SR-02 and SR-03.
This includes prioritization and implementation of adequate proactive and reactive measures for both learning pipeline and model robustness depending on their feasibility and criticality.
The implemented countermeasures must be tested by subject matter experts not involved in their design and implementation. In order to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasures, adaptive attacks are performed.
The countermeasures are documented according to PC-02.
The suitability of implemented countermeasures as well as residual risks must be formally accepted by the risk owner. In case the risk owner does not accept the remaining level of risk, SR-07 must be considered. Depending on the results of the sensitivity analysis performed in SR-04,the AI service provider must implement measures in order to limit the impact of data that users can contribute such that the functionality of the AI service stays intact while attack capabilities are reduced.","The AI service provider should implement state-of-the-art countermeasures in order to be robust against new kinds of attacks. Following examples of countermeasures can be considered:
Adversarial Defenses:
- Reactive defenses act on the input before it reaches the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service:
- Detection of adversarial examples;
- Input transformation as a preprocessing step (e.g. filters).
- Proactive defenses aim at building inherently robust models:
- Adversarial training;
- Provable defenses;
- Robust deep architectures (distillation);
- Defenses based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).
Examples of alternative countermeasures are filters, cropping-rescaling or compression and decompression.
Data poisoning defenses:
- Data sanitization;
- Anomaly detection;
- Golden dataset;
- Bounded Norm Defense.
Privacy Measures:
Countermeasures to privacy attacks should be considered. An example could be the use of privacy preserving machine learning techniques (e.g. differential privacy, federated learning)."
Security & Robustness,SR-07,Residual Risk Mitigation,"In case countermeasures derived from the tests performed in SR-04 and SR-05 do not lead to a residual risk level formally accepted by the risk owner or in case no concrete implementations are available at all, countermeasures not necessarily linked to a specific threat scenario must be implemented and tested. The implemented countermeasures must be tested adequately by subject matter experts not involved in their design and implementation. The countermeasures are to be documented according to PC-02.",
Performance & Functionality,PF-01,Definition Of Performance Requirements,"Performance requirements for the AI service are defined and included in the system description according to BC-03. The defined performance requirements include at least the following aspects:
- Performance metrics: Performance metrics to measure the quality of the AI service must respect the established rules of technology. Target values for those metrics are set in a way that the AI service fulfills the intended purpose as outlined in the system description. The metrics used to assess the accuracy of the AI service can differ based on the respective target application.
- Sensitivity analysis: The stability of the performance metrics is assessed regarding uncertainties in respective input or metadata in order to estimate confidence levels.
Changes to performance requirements are also documented in the system description according to BC-03.","The AI service provider selects adequate performance metrics to measure the quality of the AI service. The following metrics may be used and are open for further extension:
- Scoring: ROC curve, AUC curve, Gini coefficient;
- Classification: confusion matrix, F1score, recall, precision;
- Regression: Mean square error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, R2, backtesting;
- Computer Vision: Peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity;
- NLP: Perplexity, BLEU score.
It can be appropriate to use sampling methods (e.g. stratified sampling) to obtain a more meaningful representation of the population and the depiction of performance thereof.
Note that in order to measure the performance of the AI service it is necessary to measure the performance of the AI model(s) within the scope of the service."
Performance & Functionality,PF-02,Monitoring Of Performance,The AI service provider assigns personnel to continuously compute and monitor the performance metric(s) defined in PF-01. In scheduled intervals (at least quarterly) reports on the performance of the service are communicated to the responsible management of the AI service provider.,"To provide an overview of the performance of the service, dashboards should be implemented to aggregate relevant information.
The dashboards should cover the defined performance metrics of the AI service as well as KPIs that measure the underlying infrastructure performance."
Performance & Functionality,PF-03,Fulfillment of Contractual Agreement of Performance Requirements,"If the target values for the performance requirements defined in PF-01 and the description of the performance measurement procedures are incorporated in contractual agreements, identified material deviations to these contractual obligations are made transparent to users. In case of deviations responsible personnel of the AI service provider request retraining of the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service in line with PF-07.",
Performance & Functionality,PF-04,Model Selection And Suitability,"Different algorithms and model approaches are considered taking into account established rules of technology, the amount of available data, the task at hand and the performance requirements in PF-01. The documentation addresses at least the following aspects:
- Model concept: The suitability of the conceptual model to perform the intended task is described.
- Model boundaries: Limits of the conceptual model and operational boundaries are identified and their impact on the AI service is assessed.","Objectives, impact and purpose of the AI service are defined in the system description according to BC-03.
The AI service provider may define templates that help to formalize the documentation process of objectives, impact and purpose of the AI
service.
The templates may include the following points:
- Model concept: the AI model is in theory capable to capture the complexity of the learning task, e.g. for tasks where nonlinearity is a fact, linear models are not used.
- Model boundaries: The AI model has to be able to cover all cases required for the target application, e.g. an AI model trained to recognize German text, cannot be applied to English text without adjustments."
Performance & Functionality,PF-05,Model Training And Validation,"The model(s) selected under consideration of their suitability according to PF-04 are trained, tested and validated with designated data according to DQ-06 taking into account feature selection and feature engineering.
Model performance is assessed using performance metrics specified in PF-01 and uses an independent test set (i.e. data not seen by the model during training or validation). Based on the results obtained, models may need to be adjusted and retrained with different configurations (e.g. with different architectures, parameter settings or feature engineering).
The trained models are validated on independent validation data (c.f. DQ-06- Preparation of Training, Validation and Test Data) which is used to benchmark different models and to adjust hyperparameters, if necessary.
Inaccuracies of the models such as overfitting and underfitting are evaluated and addressed.
In addition, the training process includes safeguards to ensure the absence of bias with regards to BI-01.
Especially, trade-offs between performance, bias mitigation according to BI-03 and hardening according to SR-02 are considered when selecting a model. The selection process and decisive factors are documented according to PC02.
The final model specifications and achieved performance are documented according to PC02.","Depending on the model and the intended purpose, feature engineering and data cleansing/transformation (e.g. one-hot-encoding or stratified sampling) are carried out to transform the data to a form usable by the model.
For example: Solving a classification problem, a subject matter expert should start by training a linear regression model, a random forest and a neural network. For tasks, where neural networks evidently outperform other methods, three networks with different weights should be trained at the beginning. The AI service provider should use cross validation or grid search to tune the hyperparameters. Backtesting should be applied in case of timeseries data.
Evaluating and addressing overfitting:
- One indicator for overfitting can be a significantly better performance on training than on test data. Measuring feature importance can also provide insights. This can be done by applying saliency maps or tree interpreters.
- To overcome overfitting one can potentially use regularization, simpler models or fewer features. For deep learning the options of adding dropout and early stopping can be used. In addition, the number of free parameters in the model (i.e. the weights in a neural network) should be at least 5 times smaller than the number of training examples.
Evaluating and addressing underfitting:
- A bad performance on both training and test set can be an indication for underfitting or for not including appropriate features.
- To overcome underfitting, one can add more complexity to the model e.g. increase the number of free parameters or chose a different model concept."
Performance & Functionality,PF-06,Business Testing,"Tests are implemented by the AI service provider and performed by subject matter experts to ensure that the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service meet the requirements of the business process or respective target application scenario in accordance with PC-01, following the principles of Testing Changes (C5-DEV06).
The tests are performed on a regular basis in accordance with training frequency, before golive of the AI service and after major changes
(e.g. retraining). Test methodology and results are documented according to PC-02. The go-live is approved based on test results by authorized personnel.","To test the model, subject matter experts can work with a carefully chosen ""golden"" dataset which should cover (all) the possible cases the system might encounter in production extensively. This dataset can be derived from real data or be sampled to meet a special composition of features reassembling cases.
When multiple AI models are chained together, correlation between errors of the respective models may affect the performance of the AI service itself.
In addition, it can be useful to compare the AI services output/ decision with the decision made by subject matter experts."
Performance & Functionality,PF-07,Continuous Improvement Of Model Performance,"If necessary, continuous improvement of the model performance is achieved through retraining the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service and adjusting the conceptual model. Model retraining is either carried out at regular intervals (defined by the AI service provider), when the AI service is subject to model/concept drift or upon demand of responsible personnel assigned in PF-02 (Monitoring of Performance).
Retraining a model follows the same principles as outlined in PF-05 and must always incorporate new (""unseen"") data.
If retraining a model does not lead to a mitigation of the issue that triggered the retraining process, subject matter experts reconsider the model concept according to PF-04 and the risk exposure assessment according to SR-02 and SR-03. The adjustments and model changes are documented.","Concept drift: conceptual changes such as changes in products, exposures, activities, clients, user groups, frequency of requests or quality of input data can lead to a diminished performance of the service. Subject matter experts should verify that any extension of the model beyond its original scope is valid and retrain the model if necessary."
Performance & Functionality,PF-08,Additional Considerations When Using Automated Machine Learning,"If parts of the development process are subject to Automated Machine Learning (Automated ML), the following aspects are considered:

- Documentation of the integration of automated ML components.
The monitoring of the automated Machine Learning functionalities must provide all required information to measure the performance of the AI service as specified in PF-01 and information required for the model selection according to PF-04 and PF-05.","When leveraging automated machine learning in addition to the final model, a report should be provided which covers the following areas:
- Recombination of features performed through the process;
- Feature transformation such as scaling or one-hot encoding;
- Models and feature combinations evaluated;
- Parameter grid evaluated and corresponding results;
- For ensembles: combination of different models.
The results in the report should be made plausible by applying domain knowledge of subject matter experts."
Performance & Functionality,PF-09,Impact of Automated Decisionmaking,"In case of automated decision making, procedures and measures are in place that allow users of the AI service to update or modify the decisions made by the AI service as specified in BC-03.","If there are no specifications on the extent to which users are able to correct or object to the results or decisions made by the AI service, this criterion might not be applicable."
Performance & Functionality,PF-10,Regular Service Review,"Mechanisms for the review of the AI service are set up in accordance with the principles of Managing and Handling Vulnerabilities, Errors and Logs (C5-OPS-20 and C5-PSS-04).

The monitoring of AI models should also consider model theft and data poisoning scenarios according to SR-01."
Reliability,RE-04,Corrective Measures To The Output,"If the AI service allows for human intervention or correction of the AI service output, only authorized subjects are allowed to correct the output based on their rights and responsibilities. A corresponding role and rights concept is in place in accordance with the Policy for User Accounts and Access Rights (C5-IDM-01).","For the purpose of retraining a model, suggestions made by the users of the AI service are collected and assessed through established procedures."

Data sources that contain user data and that are used by the AI service are outlined in the system description according to BC-05.
An AI service that includes user feedback for training purposes highlights feedback streams as an additional data source in the documentation in line with PC-02.
In case synthetic methods are used for artificial data creation, the process is documented and made transparent to relevant users.
",Data factsheets and templates for datasets should provide a structured way for the required documentation.
Data Management,DM-04,Credibility Of Data Sources,"The data sources selected for the development of the AI service are assessed in terms of their credibility and usability by the AI service provider in accordance with the principles of the Risk Assessment for Service Providers and Suppliers (C5-SSO-02) for external data sources.
The data origin, gathering process (e.g. survey, streaming) and the level of protection of the latter are taken into account.
The assessment is documented according to PC-02 and describes the type of data source (e.g. internal vs. external data collection) as well as requirements for credibility and usability. The following points are considered additionally:
- Data needed is available in reasonable time (defined by the AI service provider) and with the required quality (see also DQ-01 or DQ-02 respectively);
- The data collection process avoids unfavorable tendencies of data according to BI-01;
- Data is retrieved in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and international standards according to BC-01, whereby these requirements shall be identified in line with the principles of the identification of applicable legal, regulatory, self-imposed or contractual requirements (C5-COM-01).
Identified issues are followed up in a timely manner which is defined by the AI service provider. The assessment is carried out by subject matter experts of the AI service provider before model training/validation takes place.
External data sources are described according to BC-05.","To protect the credibility of data adequately, data should be stored in encrypted form whenever possible.
For additional information about compliance checks see C5-COM-01 (Identification of applicable legal, regulatory, self-imposed or contractual requirements)."
Explainability,EX-01,Assessment Of The Required Degree Of Explainability,"Based on the criticality of the AI service, an assessment for the need for explainability is carried out by persons with relevant domain knowledge, taking into account:
- Purpose;
- Potential damages;
- Needs and prerequisites for human decision making;
- Adequate handling of outliers.
The results are documented in line with PC-02 and must consider the following aspects:
- Applicable legal and regulatory requirements and international standards according to BC-01 that require the explainability of actions of the AI service;
- Justified interest by users, which requires the implementation of methods to improve explainability.
The identified need of explainability to be provided by the AI service is outlined in the system description according to BC-06.",A need for explainability may for example arise during the debugging process of an AI model within the AI service.
Explainability,EX-02,Testing the Explainability of the Service,"Based on the assessment carried out in EX-01, the provided explanations must be tailored for the recipient of this information (e.g. subject matter experts, business experts of the AI service provider or users) taking the recipients know-how into account. The applied methods (e.g. saliency maps, feature importance) must consider specific characteristics of the specified input and allow for a plausible indication on why the specified output was produced by the AI service.
In case the required degree of explainability derived in EX-01 cannot be provided, subject matter experts must consider the selection of a less complex model approach (e.g. random forest instead of neural network) and the corresponding trade-off between performance and explainability.
The technical limitations of used methods and shortcomings regarding the identified needs for explainability are outlined in the system description according to BC-06.","Examples for explainability techniques can be divided into three categories that should be considered:
- Pre-Training: PCA, SOM (self-organizing maps), Clustering;
- Inherently explainable architectures:
- Linearity, monotonicity;
- Post-Training:
- Gradient-based visualizations (Saliency maps);
- Statistical Insights into features (Feature importance, PDP, ICE);
- Surrogates."
Bias,BI-01,Conceptual Assessment Of Bias,"Based on the specific characteristics of the AI
service and required functionalities, a conceptual assessment is carried out by subject matter experts to evaluate the possibility of bias within the AI service and possible implications regarding the functionality, e.g. threats or limitations. Different types of bias and their origins are considered. Implications are rated and prioritized according to their criticality.
Depending on the criticality, identified implications are followed up according to BI-02 in a timely manner. The results of the assessment are documented in line with PC-02. Identified possibilities for bias and implications affecting the functionality of the system in a critical way are outlined in the system description according to BC-06.","The following types of bias should be considered:
- Direct bias
- Indirect bias
- Systemic bias
- Statistical bias
- Explainable bias
- Unexplainable bias"
Bias,BI-02,Assessing The Level Of Bias,"Based on the implications identified through the conceptual assessment of bias (BI-01) and the rated criticality, the data and AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service are evaluated through appropriate measures to investigate the level of bias existent in the AI service.
Depending on the targeted application, potential bias is evaluated against different metrics to quantify possible effects.
The applied metrics are chosen with respect to the task at hand and expected tolerance intervals are defined by the AI service provider. If applicable, this is supplemented by measuring feature importance.
The selection of bias metrics, tolerance intervals and respective reasons are included in the system description according to BC-06. The results of the assessment are documented in line with PC-02.","Several metrics exist that can be used to quantify the level of bias. In the scientific literature, they are often called ""fairness metrics"". Here, fairness is understood as the non-existence of bias and is therefore not necessarily linked to ethical or moral considerations with regard to individuals.
The following fairness metrics may be included in the assessment:
- Equalized Odds;
- Equalized Opportunity;
- Demographic Parity;
- Fairness through awareness/unawareness."
Bias,BI-03,Mitigation Of Detected Bias,"If the applied metrics express a critical level of bias, i.e. if the defined tolerance levels from BI02 are exceeded, measures are taken to mitigate the bias. Several mitigation methods are tested on their benefit, depending on the machine learning task and their applicability to the specific domain.
Achieved results by using mitigation methods are compared on both bias measures and standard performance requirements as defined in PF-01.
If a bias occurs that is considered critical for functionality but cannot be mitigated at the time, this limitation is included in the system description according to BC-06.
","The following mitigation methods may be used and are open for further extension:
- Pre-processing:
- Disparate impact remover;
- Reweighting;
- Optimized pre-processing.
- In-processing:
- Adversarial debiasing;
- Prejudice remover.
- Post-processing:
- Calibrated equalized odds post-processing;
- Reject option classification."
Bias,BI-04,Continuous Bias Assessment,"As new data is collected and the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service are adjusted, the bias assessment and measurement are repeated regularly according to BI-01 and BI-02.
If necessary, findings are followed up with respect to BI-03.",
