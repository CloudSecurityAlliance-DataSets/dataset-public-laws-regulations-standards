(a) located at a geographical distance from the primary processing site to ensure that it bears a distinct risk profile and to prevent it from being affected by the event which has affected the primary site;  
(b) capable of ensuring the continuity of critical or important functions identically to the primary site, or providing the level of services necessary to ensure that the financial entity performs its critical operations within the recovery objectives;  
(c) immediately accessible to the financial entity’s staff to ensure continuity of critical or important functions in the event that the primary processing site has become unavailable.  

6. In determining the recovery time and recovery point objectives for each function, financial entities shall take into account whether it is a critical or important function and the potential overall impact on market efficiency. Such time objectives shall ensure that, in extreme scenarios, the agreed service levels are met.

7. When recovering from an ICT-related incident, financial entities shall perform necessary checks, including any multiple checks and reconciliations, in order to ensure that the highest level of data integrity is maintained. These checks shall also be performed when reconstructing data from external stakeholders, in order to ensure that all data is consistent between systems.

Article 13

(f) establish ICT-related incident response procedures to mitigate impacts and ensure that services become operational and secure in a timely manner.  

Article 18

Classification of ICT-related incidents and cyber threats

1. Financial entities shall classify ICT-related incidents and shall determine their impact based on the following criteria:

(a) the number and/or relevance of clients or financial counterparts affected and, where applicable, the amount or number of transactions affected by the ICT-related incident, and whether the ICT-related incident has caused reputational impact;  
(b) the duration of the ICT-related incident, including the service downtime;  
(c) the geographical spread with regard to the areas affected by the ICT-related incident, particularly if it affects more than two Member States;  
(d) the data losses that the ICT-related incident entails, in relation to availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data;  
(e) the criticality of the services affected, including the financial entity’s transactions and operations;  
(f) the economic impact, in particular direct and indirect costs and losses, of the ICT-related incident in both absolute and relative terms.  

2. Financial entities shall classify cyber threats as significant based on the criticality of the services at risk, including the financial entity’s transactions and operations, number and/or relevance of clients or financial counterparts targeted and the geographical spread of the areas at risk.

3. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee and in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, develop common draft regulatory technical standards further specifying the following:

(a) the criteria set out in paragraph 1, including materiality thresholds for determining major ICT-related incidents or, as applicable, major operational or security payment-related incidents, that are subject to the reporting obligation laid down in Article 19(1);

Article 19

Reporting of major ICT-related incidents and voluntary notification of significant cyber threats

1. Financial entities shall report major ICT-related incidents to the relevant competent authority as referred to in Article 46 in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.

Where a financial entity is subject to supervision by more than one national competent authority referred to in Article 46, Member States shall designate a single competent authority as the relevant competent authority responsible for carrying out the functions and duties provided for in this Article.

Credit institutions classified as significant, in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall report major ICT-related incidents to the relevant national competent authority designated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which shall immediately transmit that report to the ECB.

For the purpose of the first subparagraph, financial entities shall produce, after collecting and analysing all relevant information, the initial notification and reports referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article using the templates referred to in Article 20 and submit them to the competent authority. In the event that a  technical impossibility prevents the submission of the initial notification using the template, financial entities shall notify the competent authority about it via alternative means.

The initial notification and reports referred to in paragraph 4 shall include
all information necessary for the competent authority to determine the
significance of the major ICT-related incident and assess possible cross-
border impacts.

Without prejudice to the reporting pursuant to the first subparagraph by the
financial entity to the relevant competent authority, Member States may
additionally determine that some or all financial entities shall also provide
the initial notification and each report referred to in paragraph 4 of this
Article using the templates referred to in Article 20 to the competent
authorities or the computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs)
designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555.

2. Financial entities may, on a voluntary basis, notify significant cyber
threats to the relevant competent authority when they deem the threat to be of
relevance to the financial system, service users or clients. The relevant
competent authority may provide such information to other relevant authorities
referred to in paragraph 6.

Credit institutions classified as significant, in accordance with Article 6(4)
of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, may, on a voluntary basis, notify significant
cyber threats to relevant national competent authority, designated in
accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which shall immediately
transmit the notification to the ECB.

Member States may determine that those financial entities that on a voluntary
basis notify in accordance with the first subparagraph may also transmit that
notification to the CSIRTs designated or established in accordance with
Directive (EU) 2022/2555.

3. Where a major ICT-related incident occurs and has an impact on the
financial interests of clients, financial entities shall, without undue delay
as soon as they become aware of it, inform their clients about the major ICT-
related incident and about the measures that have been taken to mitigate the
adverse effects of such incident.

In the case of a significant cyber threat, financial entities shall, where
applicable, inform their clients that are potentially affected of any
appropriate protection measures which the latter may consider taking.

4. Financial entities shall, within the time limits to be laid down in
accordance with Article 20, first paragraph, point (a), point (ii), submit the
following to the relevant competent authority:

(a) an initial notification;  
(b) an intermediate report after the initial notification referred to in point (a), as soon as the status of the original incident has changed significantly or the handling of the major ICT-related incident has changed based on new information available, followed, as appropriate, by updated notifications every time a relevant status update is available, as well as upon a specific request of the competent authority;  
(c) a final report, when the root cause analysis has been completed, regardless of whether mitigation measures have already been implemented, and when the actual impact figures are available to replace estimates.  
5. Financial entities may outsource, in accordance with Union and national
sectoral law, the reporting obligations under this Article to a third-party
service provider. In case of such outsourcing, the financial entity remains
fully responsible for the fulfilment of the incident reporting requirements.

6. Upon receipt of the initial notification and of each report referred to in
paragraph 4, the competent authority shall, in a timely manner, provide
details of the major ICT-related incident to the following recipients based,
as applicable, on their respective competences:

(a) EBA, ESMA or EIOPA;  
(b) the ECB, in the case of financial entities referred to in Article 2(1), points (a), (b) and (d);  
(c) the competent authorities, single points of contact or CSIRTs designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555;  
(d) the resolution authorities, as referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2014/59/EU, and the Single Resolution Board (SRB) with respect to entities referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (37), and with respect to entities and groups referred to in Article 7(4)(b) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 if such details concern incidents that pose a risk to ensuring critical functions within the meaning of Article 2(1), point (35), of Directive 2014/59/EU; and  
(e) other relevant public authorities under national law.  
7. Following receipt of information in accordance with paragraph 6, EBA, ESMA
or EIOPA and the ECB, in consultation with ENISA and in cooperation with the
relevant competent authority, shall assess whether the major ICT-related
incident is relevant for competent authorities in other Member States.
Following that assessment, EBA, ESMA or EIOPA shall, as soon as possible,
notify relevant competent authorities in other Member States accordingly. The
ECB shall notify the members of the European System of Central Banks on issues
relevant to the payment system. Based on that notification, the competent
authorities shall, where appropriate, take all of the necessary measures to
protect the immediate stability of the financial system.

8. The notification to be done by ESMA pursuant to paragraph 7 of this
Article shall be without prejudice to the responsibility of the competent
authority to urgently transmit the details of the major ICT-related incident
to the relevant authority in the host Member State, where a central securities
depository has significant cross-border activity in the host Member State, the
major ICT-related incident is likely to have severe consequences for the
financial markets of the host Member State and where there are cooperation
arrangements among competent authorities related to the supervision of
financial entities.

authority shall, upon receipt of the initial notification and of each report
as referred to in Article 19(4), acknowledge receipt and may, where feasible,
provide in a timely manner relevant and proportionate feedback or high-level
guidance to the financial entity, in particular by making available any
relevant anonymised information and intelligence on similar threats, and may
discuss remedies applied at the level of the financial entity and ways to
minimise and mitigate adverse impact across the financial sector. Without
prejudice to the supervisory feedback received, financial entities shall
remain fully responsible for the handling and for consequences of the ICT-
related incidents reported pursuant to Article 19(1).

2. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, on an anonymised and
aggregated basis, report yearly on major ICT-related incidents, the details of
which shall be provided by competent authorities in accordance with Article
19(6), setting out at least the number of major ICT-related incidents, their
nature and their impact on the operations of financial entities or clients,
remedial actions taken and costs incurred.

The ESAs shall issue warnings and produce high-level statistics to support ICT
threat and vulnerability assessments.

Article 23

Operational or security payment-related incidents concerning credit
institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers, and
electronic money institutions

The requirements laid down in this Chapter shall also apply to operational or
security payment-related incidents and to major operational or security
payment-related incidents, where they concern credit institutions, payment
institutions, account information service providers, and electronic money
institutions.

CHAPTER IV

Digital operational resilience testing

Article 24

General requirements for the performance of digital operational resilience
testing

1. For the purpose of assessing preparedness for handling ICT-related
incidents, of identifying weaknesses, deficiencies and gaps in digital
operational resilience, and of promptly implementing corrective measures,
financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall, taking into account
the criteria set out in Article 4(2), establish, maintain and review a sound
and comprehensive digital operational resilience testing programme as an
integral part of the ICT risk-management framework referred to in Article 6.

2. The digital operational resilience testing programme shall include a range
of assessments, tests, methodologies, practices and tools to be applied in
accordance with Articles 25 and 26.

3. When conducting the digital operational resilience testing programme
referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, financial entities, other than
microenterprises, shall follow a risk-based approach taking into account the
criteria set out in Article 4(2) duly considering the evolving landscape of
ICT risk, any specific risks to which the financial entity concerned is or
might be exposed, the criticality of information assets and of services
provided, as well as any other factor the financial entity deems appropriate.

4. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure that tests
are undertaken by independent parties, whether internal or external. Where
tests are undertaken by an internal tester, financial entities shall dedicate
sufficient resources and ensure that conflicts of interest are avoided
throughout the design and execution phases of the test.

5. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall establish
procedures and policies to prioritise, classify and remedy all issues revealed
throughout the performance of the tests and shall establish internal
validation methodologies to ascertain that all identified weaknesses,
deficiencies or gaps are fully addressed.

6. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure, at least
yearly, that appropriate tests are conducted on all ICT systems and
applications supporting critical or important functions.

Article 25

Testing of ICT tools and systems

1. The digital operational resilience testing programme referred to in
Article 24 shall provide, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article
4(2), for the execution of appropriate tests, such as vulnerability
assessments and scans, open source analyses, network security assessments, gap
analyses, physical security reviews, questionnaires and scanning software
solutions, source code reviews where feasible, scenario-based tests,
compatibility testing, performance testing, end-to-end testing and penetration
testing.

2. Central securities depositories and central counterparties shall perform
vulnerability assessments before any deployment or redeployment of new or
existing applications and infrastructure components, and ICT services
supporting critical or important functions of the financial entity.

3. Microenterprises shall perform the tests referred to in paragraph 1 by
combining a risk-based approach with a strategic planning of ICT testing, by
duly considering the need to maintain a balanced approach between the scale of
resources and the time to be allocated to the ICT testing provided for in this
Article, on the one hand, and the urgency, type of risk, criticality of
information assets and of services provided, as well as any other relevant
factor, including the financial entity’s ability to take calculated risks, on
the other hand.

Article 26

Advanced testing of ICT tools, systems and processes based on TLPT

1. Financial entities, other than entities referred to in Article 16(1),
first subparagraph, and other than microenterprises, which are identified in
accordance with paragraph 8, third subparagraph, of this Article, shall carry
out at least every 3 years advanced testing by means of TLPT. Based on the
risk profile of the financial entity and taking into account operational
circumstances, the competent authority may, where necessary, request the
financial entity to reduce or increase this frequency.

2. Each threat-led penetration test shall cover several or all critical or
important functions of a financial entity, and shall be performed on live
production systems supporting such functions.

Financial entities shall identify all relevant underlying ICT systems,
processes and technologies supporting critical or important functions and ICT
services, including those supporting the critical or important functions which
have been outsourced or contracted to ICT third-party service providers.

Financial entities shall assess which critical or important functions need to
be covered by the TLPT. The result of this assessment shall determine the
precise scope of TLPT and shall be validated by the competent authorities.

3. Where ICT third-party service providers are included in the scope of TLPT,
the financial entity shall take the necessary measures and safeguards to
ensure the participation of such ICT third-party service providers in the TLPT
and shall retain at all times full responsibility for ensuring compliance with
this Regulation.

4. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, first and second subparagraphs, where
the participation of an ICT third-party service provider in the TLPT, referred
to in paragraph 3, is reasonably expected to have an adverse impact on the
quality or security of services delivered by the ICT third-party service
provider to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this
Regulation, or on the confidentiality of the data related to such services,
the financial entity and the ICT third-party service provider may agree in
writing that the ICT third-party service provider directly enters into
contractual arrangements with an external tester, for the purpose of
conducting, under the direction of one designated financial entity, a pooled
TLPT involving several financial entities (pooled testing) to which the ICT
third-party service provider provides ICT services.

That pooled testing shall cover the relevant range of ICT services supporting
critical or important functions contracted to the respective ICT third-party
service provider by the financial entities. The pooled testing shall be
considered TLPT carried out by the financial entities participating in the
pooled testing.

The number of financial entities participating in the pooled testing shall be
duly calibrated taking into account the complexity and types of services
involved.

5. Financial entities shall, with the cooperation of ICT third-party service
providers and other parties involved, including the testers but excluding the
competent authorities, apply effective risk management controls to mitigate
the risks of any potential impact on data, damage to assets, and disruption to
critical or important functions, services or operations at the financial
entity itself, its counterparts or to the financial sector.

6. At the end of the testing, after reports and remediation plans have been
agreed, the financial entity and, where applicable, the external testers shall
provide to the authority, designated in accordance with paragraph 9 or 10, a
summary of the relevant findings, the remediation plans and the documentation
demonstrating that the TLPT has been conducted in accordance with the
requirements.

7. Authorities shall provide financial entities with an attestation
confirming that the test was performed in accordance with the requirements as
evidenced in the documentation in order to allow for mutual recognition of
threat led penetration tests between competent authorities. The financial
entity shall notify the relevant competent authority of the attestation, the
summary of the relevant findings and the remediation plans.

Without prejudice to such attestation, financial entities shall remain at all
times fully responsible for the impact of the tests referred to in paragraph
4.

8. Financial entities shall contract testers for the purposes of undertaking
TLPT in accordance with Article 27. When financial entities use internal
testers for the purposes of undertaking TLPT, they shall contract external
testers every three tests.

Credit institutions that are classified as significant in accordance with
Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall only use external testers
in accordance with Article 27(1), points (a) to (e).

Competent authorities shall identify financial entities that are required to
perform TLPT taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2), based
on an assessment of the following:

(a) impact-related factors, in particular the extent to which the services provided and activities undertaken by the financial entity impact the financial sector;  
(b) possible financial stability concerns, including the systemic character of the financial entity at Union or national level, as applicable;  
(c) specific ICT risk profile, level of ICT maturity of the financial entity or technology features involved.  
9. Member States may designate a single public authority in the financial
sector to be responsible for TLPT-related matters in the financial sector at
national level and shall entrust it with all competences and tasks to that
effect.

10. In the absence of a designation in accordance with paragraph 9 of this
Article, and without prejudice to the power to identify the financial entities
that are required to perform TLPT, a competent authority may delegate the
exercise of some or all of the tasks referred to in this Article and Article
27 to another national authority in the financial sector.

11. The ESAs shall, in agreement with the ECB, develop joint draft regulatory
technical standards in accordance with the TIBER-EU framework in order to
specify further:

(a) the criteria used for the purpose of the application of paragraph 8, second subparagraph;  
(b) the requirements and standards governing the use of internal testers;  
(c) the requirements in relation to: 
    (i) the scope of TLPT referred to in paragraph 2;  
    (ii) the testing methodology and approach to be followed for each specific phase of the testing process;  
    (iii) the results, closure and remediation stages of the testing;  
(d) the type of supervisory and other relevant cooperation which are needed for the implementation of TLPT, and for the facilitation of mutual recognition of that testing, in the context of financial entities that operate in more than one Member State, to allow an appropriate level of supervisory involvement and a flexible implementation to cater for specificities of financial sub-sectors or local financial markets.  
When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall
give due consideration to any specific feature arising from the distinct
nature of activities across different financial services sectors.

The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the
Commission by 17 July 2024.

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting
the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in
accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No
1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.

Article 27

Requirements for testers for the carrying out of TLPT

1. Financial entities shall only use testers for the carrying out of TLPT,
that:

(a) are of the highest suitability and reputability;  
(b) possess technical and organisational capabilities and demonstrate specific expertise in threat intelligence, penetration testing and red team testing;  
(c) are certified by an accreditation body in a Member State or adhere to formal codes of conduct or ethical frameworks;  
(d) provide an independent assurance, or an audit report, in relation to the sound management of risks associated with the carrying out of TLPT, including the due protection of the financial entity’s confidential information and redress for the business risks of the financial entity;  
(e) are duly and fully covered by relevant professional indemnity insurances, including against risks of misconduct and negligence.  
2. When using internal testers, financial entities shall ensure that, in
addition to the requirements in paragraph 1, the following conditions are met:

(a) such use has been approved by the relevant competent authority or by the single public authority designated in accordance with Article 26(9) and (10);  
(b) the relevant competent authority has verified that the financial entity has sufficient dedicated resources and ensured that conflicts of interest are avoided throughout the design and execution phases of the test; and  
(c) the threat intelligence provider is external to the financial entity.  
3. Financial entities shall ensure that contracts concluded with external
testers require a sound management of the TLPT results and that any data
processing thereof, including any generation, store, aggregation, draft,
report, communication or destruction, do not create risks to the financial
entity.

CHAPTER V

Managing of ICT third-party risk

Section I

Key principles for a sound management of ICT third-party risk

Article 28

General principles

1. Financial entities shall manage ICT third-party risk as an integral
component of ICT risk within their ICT risk management framework as referred
to in Article 6(1), and in accordance with the following principles:

(a) financial entities that have in place contractual arrangements for the use of ICT services to run their business operations shall, at all times, remain fully responsible for compliance with, and the discharge of, all obligations under this Regulation and applicable financial services law;  
(b) financial entities’ management of ICT third-party risk shall be implemented in light of the principle of proportionality, taking into account: 
    (i) the nature, scale, complexity and importance of ICT-related dependencies,  
    (ii) the risks arising from contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services concluded with ICT third-party service providers, taking into account the criticality or importance of the respective service, process or function, and the potential impact on the continuity and availability of financial services and activities, at individual and at group level.  
2. As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities, other
than entities referred to in Article 16(1), first subparagraph, and other than
microenterprises, shall adopt, and regularly review, a strategy on ICT third-
party risk, taking into account the multi-vendor strategy referred to in
Article 6(9), where applicable. The strategy on ICT third-party risk shall
include a policy on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important
functions provided by ICT third-party service providers and shall apply on an
individual basis and, where relevant, on a sub-consolidated and consolidated
basis. The management body shall, on the basis of an assessment of the overall
risk profile of the financial entity and the scale and complexity of the
business services, regularly review the risks identified in respect to
contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or
important functions.

3. As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities shall
maintain and update at entity level, and at sub-consolidated and consolidated
levels, a register of information in relation to all contractual arrangements
on the use of ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers.

The contractual arrangements referred to in the first subparagraph shall be
appropriately documented, distinguishing between those that cover ICT services
supporting critical or important functions and those that do not.

Financial entities shall report at least yearly to the competent authorities
on the number of new arrangements on the use of ICT services, the categories
of ICT third-party service providers, the type of contractual arrangements and
the ICT services and functions which are being provided.

Financial entities shall make available to the competent authority, upon its
request, the full register of information or, as requested, specified sections
thereof, along with any information deemed necessary to enable the effective
supervision of the financial entity.

Financial entities shall inform the competent authority in a timely manner
about any planned contractual arrangement on the use of ICT services
supporting critical or important functions as well as when a function has
become critical or important.

4. Before entering into a contractual arrangement on the use of ICT services,
financial entities shall:

(a) assess whether the contractual arrangement covers the use of ICT services supporting a critical or important function;  
(b) assess if supervisory conditions for contracting are met;  
(c) identify and assess all relevant risks in relation to the contractual arrangement, including the possibility that such contractual arrangement may contribute to reinforcing ICT concentration risk as referred to in Article 29;  
(d) undertake all due diligence on prospective ICT third-party service providers and ensure throughout the selection and assessment processes that the ICT third-party service provider is suitable;  
(e) identify and assess conflicts of interest that the contractual arrangement may cause.  
5. Financial entities may only enter into contractual arrangements with ICT
third-party service providers that comply with appropriate information
security standards. When those contractual arrangements concern critical or
important functions, financial entities shall, prior to concluding the
arrangements, take due consideration of the use, by ICT third-party service
providers, of the most up-to-date and highest quality information security
standards.

6. In exercising access, inspection and audit rights over the ICT third-party
service provider, financial entities shall, on the basis of a risk-based
approach, pre-determine the frequency of audits and inspections as well as the
areas to be audited through adhering to commonly accepted audit standards in
line with any supervisory instruction on the use and incorporation of such
audit standards.

Where contractual arrangements concluded with ICT third-party service
providers on the use of ICT services entail high technical complexity, the
financial entity shall verify that auditors, whether internal or external, or
a pool of auditors, possess appropriate skills and knowledge to effectively
perform the relevant audits and assessments.

7. Financial entities shall ensure that contractual arrangements on the use
of ICT services may be terminated in any of the following circumstances:

(a) significant breach by the ICT third-party service provider of applicable laws, regulations or contractual terms;  
(b) circumstances identified throughout the monitoring of ICT third-party risk that are deemed capable of altering the performance of the functions provided through the contractual arrangement, including material changes that affect the arrangement or the situation of the ICT third-party service provider;  
(c) ICT third-party service provider’s evidenced weaknesses pertaining to its overall ICT risk management and in particular in the way it ensures the availability, authenticity, integrity and, confidentiality, of data, whether personal or otherwise sensitive data, or non-personal data;  
(d) where the competent authority can no longer effectively supervise the financial entity as a result of the conditions of, or circumstances related to, the respective contractual arrangement.  
8. For ICT services supporting critical or important functions, financial
entities shall put in place exit strategies. The exit strategies shall take
into account risks that may emerge at the level of ICT third-party service
providers, in particular a possible failure on their part, a deterioration of
the quality of the ICT services provided, any business disruption due to
inappropriate or failed provision of ICT services or any material risk arising
in relation to the appropriate and continuous deployment of the respective ICT
service, or the termination of contractual arrangements with ICT third-party
service providers under any of the circumstances listed in paragraph 7.

Financial entities shall ensure that they are able to exit contractual
arrangements without:

(a) disruption to their business activities,  
(b) limiting compliance with regulatory requirements,  
(c) detriment to the continuity and quality of services provided to clients.  
Exit plans shall be comprehensive, documented and, in accordance with the
criteria set out in Article 4(2), shall be sufficiently tested and reviewed
periodically.

Financial entities shall identify alternative solutions and develop transition
plans enabling them to remove the contracted ICT services and the relevant
data from the ICT third-party service provider and to securely and integrally
transfer them to alternative providers or reincorporate them in-house.

Financial entities shall have appropriate contingency measures in place to
maintain business continuity in the event of the circumstances referred to in
the first subparagraph.

9. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft implementing
technical standards to establish the standard templates for the purposes of
the register of information referred to in paragraph 3, including information
that is common to all contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services. The
ESAs shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the
Commission by 17 January 2024.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical
standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15
of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.

10. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft regulatory
technical standards to further specify the detailed content of the policy
referred to in paragraph 2 in relation to the contractual arrangements on the
use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provided by ICT
third-party service providers.

When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall
take into account the size and the overall risk profile of the financial
entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and
operations. The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards
to the Commission by 17 January 2024.

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting
the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in
accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No
1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.

Article 29

Preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk at entity level

1. When performing the identification and assessment of risks referred to in
Article 28(4), point (c), financial entities shall also take into account
whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to
ICT services supporting critical or important functions would lead to any of
the following:

(a) contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable; or  
(b) having in place multiple contractual arrangements in relation to the provision of ICT services supporting critical or important functions with the same ICT third-party service provider or with closely connected ICT third-party service providers.  
Financial entities shall weigh the benefits and costs of alternative
solutions, such as the use of different ICT third-party service providers,
taking into account if and how envisaged solutions match the business needs
and objectives set out in their digital resilience strategy.

2. Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting
critical or important functions include the possibility that an ICT third-
party service provider further subcontracts ICT services supporting a critical
or important function to other ICT third-party service providers, financial
entities shall weigh benefits and risks that may arise in connection with such
subcontracting, in particular in the case of an ICT subcontractor established
in a third-country.

Where contractual arrangements concern ICT services supporting critical or
important functions, financial entities shall duly consider the insolvency law
provisions that would apply in the event of the ICT third-party service
provider’s bankruptcy as well as any constraint that may arise in respect to
the urgent recovery of the financial entity’s data.

Where contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical
or important functions are concluded with an ICT third-party service provider
established in a third country, financial entities shall, in addition to the
considerations referred to in the second subparagraph, also consider the
compliance with Union data protection rules and the effective enforcement of
the law in that third country.

Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting
critical or important functions provide for subcontracting, financial entities
shall assess whether and how potentially long or complex chains of
subcontracting may impact their ability to fully monitor the contracted
functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively supervise
the financial entity in that respect.

Article 30

Key contractual provisions

1. The rights and obligations of the financial entity and of the ICT third-
party service provider shall be clearly allocated and set out in writing. The
full contract shall include the service level agreements and be documented in
one written document which shall be available to the parties on paper, or in a
document with another downloadable, durable and accessible format.

2. The contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services shall include at
least the following elements:

(a) a clear and complete description of all functions and ICT services to be provided by the ICT third-party service provider, indicating whether subcontracting of an ICT service supporting a critical or important function, or material parts thereof, is permitted and, when that is the case, the conditions applying to such subcontracting;  
(b) the locations, namely the regions or countries, where the contracted or subcontracted functions and ICT services are to be provided and where data is to be processed, including the storage location, and the requirement for the ICT third-party service provider to notify the financial entity in advance if it envisages changing such locations;  
(c) provisions on availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality in relation to the protection of data, including personal data;  
(d) provisions on ensuring access, recovery and return in an easily accessible format of personal and non-personal data processed by the financial entity in the event of the insolvency, resolution or discontinuation of the business operations of the ICT third-party service provider, or in the event of the termination of the contractual arrangements;  
(e) service level descriptions, including updates and revisions thereof;  
(f) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to provide assistance to the financial entity at no additional cost, or at a cost that is determined ex-ante, when an ICT incident that is related to the ICT service provided to the financial entity occurs;  
(g) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to fully cooperate with the competent authorities and the resolution authorities of the financial entity, including persons appointed by them;  
(h) termination rights and related minimum notice periods for the termination of the contractual arrangements, in accordance with the expectations of competent authorities and resolution authorities;  
(i) the conditions for the participation of ICT third-party service providers in the financial entities’ ICT security awareness programmes and digital operational resilience training in accordance with Article 13(6).  
3. The contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting
critical or important functions shall include, in addition to the elements
referred to in paragraph 2, at least the following:

(a) full service level descriptions, including updates and revisions thereof with precise quantitative and qualitative performance targets within the agreed service levels to allow effective monitoring by the financial entity of ICT services and enable appropriate corrective actions to be taken, without undue delay, when agreed service levels are not met;  
(b) notice periods and reporting obligations of the ICT third-party service provider to the financial entity, including notification of any development that might have a material impact on the ICT third-party service provider’s ability to effectively provide the ICT services supporting critical or important functions in line with agreed service levels;  
(c) requirements for the ICT third-party service provider to implement and test business contingency plans and to have in place ICT security measures, tools and policies that provide an appropriate level of security for the provision of services by the financial entity in line with its regulatory framework;  
(d) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to participate and fully cooperate in the financial entity’s TLPT as referred to in Articles 26 and 27;  
(e) the right to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the ICT third-party service provider’s performance, which entails the following:
    (i) unrestricted rights of access, inspection and audit by the financial entity, or an appointed third party, and by the competent authority, and the right to take copies of relevant documentation on-site if they are critical to the operations of the ICT third-party service provider, the effective exercise of which is not impeded or limited by other contractual arrangements or implementation policies;  
    (ii) the right to agree on alternative assurance levels if other clients’ rights are affected;  
    (iii) the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to fully cooperate during the onsite inspections and audits performed by the competent authorities, the Lead Overseer, financial entity or an appointed third party; and  
    (iv) the obligation to provide details on the scope, procedures to be followed and frequency of such inspections and audits;  
(f) exit strategies, in particular the establishment of a mandatory adequate transition period: 
    (i) during which the ICT third-party service provider will continue providing the respective functions, or ICT services, with a view to reducing the risk of disruption at the financial entity or to ensure its effective resolution and restructuring;  
    (ii) allowing the financial entity to migrate to another ICT third-party service provider or change to in-house solutions consistent with the complexity of the service provided.  
By way of derogation from point (e), the ICT third-party service provider and
the financial entity that is a microenterprise may agree that the financial
entity’s rights of access, inspection and audit can be delegated to an
independent third party, appointed by the ICT third-party service provider,
and that the financial entity is able to request information and assurance on
the ICT third-party service provider’s performance from the third party at any
time.

4. When negotiating contractual arrangements, financial entities and ICT
third-party service providers shall consider the use of standard contractual
clauses developed by public authorities for specific services.

5. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft regulatory
technical standards to specify further the elements referred to in paragraph
2, point (a), which a financial entity needs to determine and assess when
subcontracting ICT services supporting critical or important functions.

When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall
take into consideration the size and overall risk profile of the financial
entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and
operations.

The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the
Commission by 17 July 2024.

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting
the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in
accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No
1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.

Section II

Oversight Framework of critical ICT third-party service providers

Article 31

Designation of critical ICT third-party service providers

1. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee and upon recommendation from the
Oversight Forum established pursuant to Article 32(1), shall:

(a) designate the ICT third-party service providers that are critical for financial entities, following an assessment that takes into account the criteria specified in paragraph 2;  
(b) appoint as Lead Overseer for each critical ICT third-party service provider the ESA that is responsible, in accordance with Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 or (EU) No 1095/2010, for the financial entities having together the largest share of total assets out of the value of total assets of all financial entities using the services of the relevant critical ICT third-party service provider, as evidenced by the sum of the individual balance sheets of those financial entities.  
2. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall be based on
all of the following criteria in relation to ICT services provided by the ICT
third-party service provider:

(a) the systemic impact on the stability, continuity or quality of the provision of financial services in the event that the relevant ICT third-party service provider would face a large scale operational failure to provide its services, taking into account the number of financial entities and the total value of assets of financial entities to which the relevant ICT third-party service provider provides services;  
(b) the systemic character or importance of the financial entities that rely on the relevant ICT third-party service provider, assessed in accordance with the following parameters:
    (i) the number of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) that rely on the respective ICT third-party service provider;  
    (ii) the interdependence between the G-SIIs or O-SIIs referred to in point (i) and other financial entities, including situations where the G-SIIs or O-SIIs provide financial infrastructure services to other financial entities;  
(c) the reliance of financial entities on the services provided by the relevant ICT third-party service provider in relation to critical or important functions of financial entities that ultimately involve the same ICT third-party service provider, irrespective of whether financial entities rely on those services directly or indirectly, through subcontracting arrangements;  
(d) the degree of substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider, taking into account the following parameters: 
    (i) the lack of real alternatives, even partial, due to the limited number of ICT third-party service providers active on a specific market, or the market share of the relevant ICT third-party service provider, or the technical complexity or sophistication involved, including in relation to any proprietary technology, or the specific features of the ICT third-party service provider’s organisation or activity;  
    (ii) difficulties in relation to partially or fully migrating the relevant data and workloads from the relevant ICT third-party service provider to another ICT third-party service provider, due either to significant financial costs, time or other resources that the migration process may entail, or to increased ICT risk or other operational risks to which the financial entity may be exposed through such migration.  
3. Where the ICT third-party service provider belongs to a group, the
criteria referred to in paragraph 2 shall be considered in relation to the ICT
services provided by the group as a whole.

4. Critical ICT third-party service providers which are part of a group shall
designate one legal person as a coordination point to ensure adequate

Article 33

Tasks of the Lead Overseer

1. The Lead Overseer, appointed in accordance with Article 31(1), point (b),
shall conduct the oversight of the assigned critical ICT third-party service
providers and shall be, for the purposes of all matters related to the
oversight, the primary point of contact for those critical ICT third-party
service providers.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Lead Overseer shall assess whether
each critical ICT third-party service provider has in place comprehensive,
sound and effective rules, procedures, mechanisms and arrangements to manage
the ICT risk which it may pose to financial entities.

The assessment referred to in the first subparagraph shall focus mainly on ICT
services provided by the critical ICT third-party service provider supporting
the critical or important functions of financial entities. Where necessary to
address all relevant risks, that assessment shall extend to ICT services
supporting functions other than those that are critical or important.

3. The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall cover:

(a) ICT requirements to ensure, in particular, the security, availability, continuity, scalability and quality of services which the critical ICT third-party service provider provides to financial entities, as well as the ability to maintain at all times high standards of availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data;  
(b) the physical security contributing to ensuring the ICT security, including the security of premises, facilities, data centres;  
(c) the risk management processes, including ICT risk management policies, ICT business continuity policy and ICT response and recovery plans;  
(d) the governance arrangements, including an organisational structure with clear, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility and accountability rules enabling effective ICT risk management;  
(e) the identification, monitoring and prompt reporting of material ICT-related incidents to financial entities, the management and resolution of those incidents, in particular cyber-attacks;  
(f) the mechanisms for data portability, application portability and interoperability, which ensure an effective exercise of termination rights by the financial entities;  
(g) the testing of ICT systems, infrastructure and controls;  
(h) the ICT audits;  
(i) the use of relevant national and international standards applicable to the provision of its ICT services to the financial entities.  
4. Based on the assessment referred to in paragraph 2, and in coordination
with the Joint Oversight Network (JON) referred to in Article 34(1), the Lead
Overseer shall adopt a clear, detailed and reasoned individual oversight plan
describing the annual oversight objectives and the main oversight actions
planned for each critical ICT third-party service provider. That plan shall be
communicated yearly to the critical ICT third-party service provider.

Prior to the adoption of the oversight plan, the Lead Overseer shall
communicate the draft oversight plan to the critical ICT third-party service
provider.

Upon receipt of the draft oversight plan, the critical ICT third-party service
provider may submit a reasoned statement within 15 calendar days evidencing
the expected impact on customers which are entities falling outside of the
scope of this Regulation and where appropriate, formulating solutions to
mitigate risks.

5. Once the annual oversight plans referred to in paragraph 4 have been
adopted and notified to the critical ICT third-party service providers,
competent authorities may take measures concerning such critical ICT third-
party service providers only in agreement with the Lead Overseer.

Article 34

Operational coordination between Lead Overseers

1. To ensure a consistent approach to oversight activities and with a view to
enabling coordinated general oversight strategies and cohesive operational
approaches and work methodologies, the three Lead Overseers appointed in
accordance with Article 31(1), point (b), shall set up a JON to coordinate
among themselves in the preparatory stages and to coordinate the conduct of
oversight activities over their respective overseen critical ICT third-party
service providers, as well as in the course of any action that may be needed
pursuant to Article 42.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Lead Overseers shall draw up a common
oversight protocol specifying the detailed procedures to be followed for
carrying out the day-to-day coordination and for ensuring swift exchanges and
reactions. The protocol shall be periodically revised to reflect operational
needs, in particular the evolution of practical oversight arrangements.

3. The Lead Overseers may, on an ad-hoc basis, call on the ECB and ENISA to
provide technical advice, share hands-on experience or join specific
coordination meetings of the JON.

Article 35

Powers of the Lead Overseer

1. For the purposes of carrying out the duties laid down in this Section, the
Lead Overseer shall have the following powers in respect of the critical ICT
third-party service providers:

(a) to request all relevant information and documentation in accordance with Article 37;  
(b) to conduct general investigations and inspections in accordance with Articles 38 and 39, respectively;  
(c) to request, after the completion of the oversight activities, reports specifying the actions that have been taken or the remedies that have been implemented by the critical ICT third-party service providers in relation to the recommendations referred to in point (d) of this paragraph;  
(d) to issue recommendations on the areas referred to in Article 33(3), in particular concerning the following: 
    (i) the use of specific ICT security and quality requirements or processes, in particular in relation to the roll-out of patches, updates, encryption and other security measures which the Lead Overseer deems relevant for ensuring the ICT security of services provided to financial entities;      
    (ii) the use of conditions and terms, including their technical implementation, under which the critical ICT third-party service providers provide ICT services to financial entities, which the Lead Overseer deems relevant for preventing the generation of single points of failure, the amplification thereof, or for minimising the possible systemic impact across the Union’s financial sector in the event of ICT concentration risk;  
    (iii) any planned subcontracting, where the Lead Overseer deems that further subcontracting, including subcontracting arrangements which the critical ICT third-party service providers plan to enter into with ICT third-party service providers or with ICT subcontractors established in a third country, may trigger risks for the provision of services by the financial entity, or risks to the financial stability, based on the examination of the information gathered in accordance with Articles 37 and 38;  
    (iv) refraining from entering into a further subcontracting arrangement, where the following cumulative conditions are met: 
        — the envisaged subcontractor is an ICT third-party service provider or an ICT subcontractor established in a third country;  
        — the subcontracting concerns critical or important functions of the financial entity; and  
        — the Lead Overseer deems that the use of such subcontracting poses a clear and serious risk to the financial stability of the Union or to financial entities, including to the ability of financial entities to comply with supervisory requirements.  
For the purpose of point (iv) of this point, ICT third-party service providers
shall, using the template referred to in Article 41(1), point (b), transmit
the information regarding subcontracting to the Lead Overseer.  
2. When exercising the powers referred to in this Article, the Lead Overseer
shall:

(a) ensure regular coordination within the JON, and in particular shall seek consistent approaches, as appropriate, with regard to the oversight of critical ICT third-party service providers;  
(b) take due account of the framework established by Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and, where necessary, consult the relevant competent authorities designated or established in accordance with that Directive, in order to avoid duplication of technical and organisational measures that might apply to critical ICT third-party service providers pursuant to that Directive;  
(c) seek to minimise, to the extent possible, the risk of disruption to services provided by critical ICT third-party service providers to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation.  
3. The Lead Overseer shall consult the Oversight Forum before exercising the
powers referred to in paragraph 1.

Before issuing recommendations in accordance with paragraph 1, point (d), the
Lead Overseer shall give the opportunity to the ICT third-party service
provider to provide, within 30 calendar days, relevant information evidencing
the expected impact on customers that are entities falling outside the scope
of this Regulation and, where appropriate, formulating solutions to mitigate
risks.

4. The Lead Overseer shall inform the JON of the outcome of the exercise of
the powers referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b). The Lead Overseer
shall, without undue delay, transmit the reports referred to in paragraph 1,
point (c), to the JON and to the competent authorities of the financial
entities using the ICT services of that critical ICT third-party service
provider.

5. Critical ICT third-party service providers shall cooperate in good faith
with the Lead Overseer, and assist it in the fulfilment of its tasks.

6. In the event of whole or partial non-compliance with the measures required
to be taken pursuant to the exercise of the powers under paragraph 1, points
(a), (b) and (c), and after the expiry of a period of at least 30 calendar
days from the date on which the critical ICT third-party service provider
received notification of the respective measures, the Lead Overseer shall
adopt a decision imposing a periodic penalty payment to compel the critical
ICT third-party service provider to comply with those measures.

7. The periodic penalty payment referred to in paragraph 6 shall be imposed
on a daily basis until compliance is achieved and for no more than a period of
six months following the notification of the decision to impose a periodic
penalty payment to the critical ICT third-party service provider.

8. The amount of the periodic penalty payment, calculated from the date
stipulated in the decision imposing the periodic penalty payment, shall be up
to 1 % of the average daily worldwide turnover of the critical ICT third-party
service provider in the preceding business year. When determining the amount
of the penalty payment, the Lead Overseer shall take into account the
following criteria regarding non-compliance with the measures referred to in
paragraph 6:

(a) the gravity and the duration of non-compliance;  
(b) whether non-compliance has been committed intentionally or negligently;  
(c) the level of cooperation of the ICT third-party service provider with the Lead Overseer.  
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, in order to ensure a consistent
approach, the Lead Overseer shall engage in consultation within the JON.

9. Penalty payments shall be of an administrative nature and shall be
enforceable. Enforcement shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure in
force in the Member State on the territory of which inspections and access
shall be carried out. Courts of the Member State concerned shall have
jurisdiction over complaints related to irregular conduct of enforcement. The
amounts of the penalty payments shall be allocated to the general budget of
the European Union.

10. The Lead Overseer shall disclose to the public every periodic penalty
payment that has been imposed, unless such disclosure would seriously
jeopardise the financial markets or cause disproportionate damage to the
parties involved.

11. Before imposing a periodic penalty payment under paragraph 6, the Lead
Overseer shall give the representatives of the critical ICT third-party
service provider subject to the proceedings the opportunity to be heard on the
findings and shall base its decisions only on findings on which the critical
ICT third-party service provider subject to the proceedings has had an
opportunity to comment.

The rights of the defence of the persons subject to the proceedings shall be
fully respected in the proceedings. The critical ICT third-party service
provider subject to the proceedings shall be entitled to have access to the
file, subject to the legitimate interest of other persons in the protection of
their business secrets. The right of access to the file shall not extend to
confidential information or to the Lead Overseer’s internal preparatory
documents.

Article 36

Exercise of the powers of the Lead Overseer outside the Union

shall conclude administrative cooperation arrangements with the relevant
authority of the third country in order to enable the smooth conduct of
inspections in the third country concerned by the Lead Overseer and its
designated team for its mission in that third country. Those cooperation
arrangements shall not create legal obligations in respect of the Union and
its Member States nor shall they prevent Member States and their competent
authorities from concluding bilateral or multilateral arrangements with those
third countries and their relevant authorities.

Those cooperation arrangements shall specify at least the following elements:

(a) the procedures for the coordination of oversight activities carried out under this Regulation and any analogous monitoring of ICT third-party risk in the financial sector exercised by the relevant authority of the third country concerned, including details for transmitting the agreement of the latter to allow the conduct, by the Lead Overseer and its designated team, of general investigations and on-site inspections as referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, on the territory under its jurisdiction;

(a) the information to be provided by an ICT third-party service provider in the application for a voluntary request to be designated as critical under Article 31(11);  
(b) the content, structure and format of the information to be submitted, disclosed or reported by the ICT third-party service providers pursuant to Article 35(1), including the template for providing information on subcontracting arrangements;  
(c) the criteria for determining the composition of the joint examination team ensuring a balanced participation of staff members from the ESAs and from the relevant competent authorities, their designation, tasks, and working arrangements.  
(d) the details of the competent authorities’ assessment of the measures taken by critical ICT third-party service providers based on the recommendations of the Lead Overseer pursuant to Article 42(3).  
2. The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the
Commission by 17 July 2024.

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting
the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 1 in accordance
with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No
1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.

Article 42

Follow-up by competent authorities

1. Within 60 calendar days of the receipt of the recommendations issued by
the Lead Overseer pursuant to Article 35(1), point (d), critical ICT third-
party service providers shall either notify the Lead Overseer of their
intention to follow the recommendations or provide a reasoned explanation for
not following such recommendations. The Lead Overseer shall immediately
transmit this information to the competent authorities of the financial
entities concerned.

2. The Lead Overseer shall publicly disclose where a critical ICT third-party
service provider fails to notify the Lead Overseer in accordance with
paragraph 1 or where the explanation provided by the critical ICT third-party
service provider is not deemed sufficient. The information published shall
disclose the identity of the critical ICT third-party service provider as well
as information on the type and nature of the non-compliance. Such information
shall be limited to what is relevant and proportionate for the purpose of
ensuring public awareness, unless such publication would cause
disproportionate damage to the parties involved or could seriously jeopardise
the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or the stability of
the whole or part of the financial system of the Union.

The Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of that
public disclosure.

3. Competent authorities shall inform the relevant financial entities of the
risks identified in the recommendations addressed to critical ICT third-party
service providers in accordance with Article 35(1), point (d).

When managing ICT third-party risk, financial entities shall take into account
the risks referred to in the first subparagraph.

4. Where a competent authority deems that a financial entity fails to take
into account or to sufficiently address within its management of ICT third-
party risk the specific risks identified in the recommendations, it shall
notify the financial entity of the possibility of a decision being taken,
within 60 calendar days of the receipt of such notification, pursuant to
paragraph 6, in the absence of appropriate contractual arrangements aiming to
address such risks.

5. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c), and
prior to taking a decision as referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article,
competent authorities may, on a voluntary basis, consult the competent
authorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU)
2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important entity
subject to that Directive, which has been designated as a critical ICT third-
party service provider.

6. Competent authorities may, as a measure of last resort, following the
notification and, if appropriate, the consultation as set out in paragraph 4
and 5 of this Article, in accordance with Article 50, take a decision
requiring financial entities to temporarily suspend, either in part or
completely, the use or deployment of a service provided by the critical ICT
third-party service provider until the risks identified in the recommendations
addressed to critical ICT third-party service providers have been addressed.
Where necessary, they may require financial entities to terminate, in part or
completely, the relevant contractual arrangements concluded with the critical
ICT third-party service providers.

7. Where a critical ICT third-party service provider refuses to endorse
recommendations, based on a divergent approach from the one advised by the
Lead Overseer, and such a divergent approach may adversely impact a large
number of financial entities, or a significant part of the financial sector,
and individual warnings issued by competent authorities have not resulted in
consistent approaches mitigating the potential risk to financial stability,
the Lead Overseer may, after consulting the Oversight Forum, issue non-binding
and non-public opinions to competent authorities, in order to promote
consistent and convergent supervisory follow-up measures, as appropriate.

8. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c),
competent authorities, when taking a decision as referred to in paragraph 6 of
this Article, shall take into account the type and magnitude of risk that is
not addressed by the critical ICT third-party service provider, as well as the
seriousness of the non-compliance, having regard to the following criteria:

(a) the gravity and the duration of the non-compliance;  
(b) whether the non-compliance has revealed serious weaknesses in the critical ICT third-party service provider’s procedures, management systems, risk management and internal controls;  
(c) whether a financial crime was facilitated, occasioned or is otherwise attributable to the non-compliance;  
(d) whether the non-compliance has been intentional or negligent;  
(e) whether the suspension or termination of the contractual arrangements introduces a risk for continuity of the financial entity’s business operations notwithstanding the financial entity’s efforts to avoid disruption in the provision of its services;  
(f) where applicable, the opinion of the competent authorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important entity subject to that Directive, which has been designated as a critical ICT third-party service provider, requested on a voluntary basis in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article.  
Competent authorities shall grant financial entities the necessary period of
time to enable them to adjust the contractual arrangements with critical ICT
third-party service providers in order to avoid detrimental effects on their
digital operational resilience and to allow them to deploy exit strategies and
transition plans as referred to in Article 28.

9. The decision referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article shall be notified
to the members of the Oversight Forum referred to in Article 32(4), points
(a), (b) and (c), and to the JON.

The critical ICT third-party service providers affected by the decisions
provided for in paragraph 6 shall fully cooperate with the financial entities
impacted, in particular in the context of the process of suspension or
termination of their contractual arrangements.

10. Competent authorities shall regularly inform the Lead Overseer on the
approaches and measures taken in their supervisory tasks in relation to
financial entities as well as on the contractual arrangements concluded by
financial entities where critical ICT third-party service providers have not
endorsed in part or entirely recommendations addressed to them by the Lead
Overseer.

11. The Lead Overseer may, upon request, provide further clarifications on
the recommendations issued to guide the competent authorities on the follow-up
measures.

Article 43

Oversight fees

1. The Lead Overseer shall, in accordance with the delegated act referred to
in paragraph 2 of this Article, charge critical ICT third-party service
providers fees that fully cover the Lead Overseer’s necessary expenditure in
relation to the conduct of oversight tasks pursuant to this Regulation,
including the reimbursement of any costs which may be incurred as a result of
work carried out by the joint examination team referred to in Article 40, as
well as the costs of advice provided by the independent experts as referred to
in Article 32(4), second subparagraph, in relation to matters falling under
the remit of direct oversight activities.

The amount of a fee charged to a critical ICT third-party service provider
shall cover all costs derived from the execution of the duties set out in this
Section and shall be proportionate to its turnover.

2. The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with
Article 57 to supplement this Regulation by determining the amount of the fees
and the way in which they are to be paid by 17 July 2024.

Article 44

International cooperation

1. Without prejudice to Article 36, EBA, ESMA and EIOPA may, in accordance
with Article 33 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1095/2010 and (EU)
No 1094/2010, respectively, conclude administrative arrangements with third-
country regulatory and supervisory authorities to foster international
cooperation on ICT third-party risk across different financial sectors, in
particular by developing best practices for the review of ICT risk management
practices and controls, mitigation measures and incident responses.

2. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, submit every five years a
joint confidential report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to
the Commission, summarising the findings of relevant discussions held with the
third countries’ authorities referred to in paragraph 1, focusing on the
evolution of ICT third-party risk and the implications for financial
stability, market integrity, investor protection and the functioning of the
internal market.

CHAPTER VI

Information-sharing arrangements

Article 45

Information-sharing arrangements on cyber threat information and intelligence

1. Financial entities may exchange amongst themselves cyber threat
information and intelligence, including indicators of compromise, tactics,
techniques, and procedures, cyber security alerts and configuration tools, to
the extent that such information and intelligence sharing:

(a) aims to enhance the digital operational resilience of financial entities, in particular through raising awareness in relation to cyber threats, limiting or impeding the cyber threats’ ability to spread, supporting defence capabilities, threat detection techniques, mitigation strategies or response and recovery stages;  
(b) takes places within trusted communities of financial entities;  
(c) is implemented through information-sharing arrangements that protect the potentially sensitive nature of the information shared, and that are governed by rules of conduct in full respect of business confidentiality, protection of personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and guidelines on competition policy.  
2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, point (c), the information-sharing
arrangements shall define the conditions for participation and, where
appropriate, shall set out the details on the involvement of public
authorities and the capacity in which they may be associated to the
information-sharing arrangements, on the involvement of ICT third-party
service providers, and on operational elements, including the use of dedicated
IT platforms.

3. Financial entities shall notify competent authorities of their
participation in the information-sharing arrangements referred to in paragraph
1, upon validation of their membership, or, as applicable, of the cessation of
their membership, once it takes effect.

disproportionate, including risks in relation to the protection of personal
data, jeopardise the stability of financial markets or the pursuit of an

anonymous basis in accordance with paragraph 3, point (b), the publication of
the relevant data may be postponed.

5. Where a competent authority publishes a decision imposing an
administrative penalty against which there is an appeal before the relevant
judicial authorities, competent authorities shall immediately add on their
