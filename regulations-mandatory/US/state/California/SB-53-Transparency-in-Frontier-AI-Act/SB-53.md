## LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

**SB 53, Wiener. Artificial intelligence models: large developers.**

### (1) Existing Law

Existing law generally regulates artificial intelligence, including by requiring, on or before January 1, 2026, and before each time thereafter, that a generative artificial intelligence system or service, or a substantial modification to a generative artificial intelligence system or service, released on or after January 1, 2022, is made publicly available to Californians for use, the developer of the system or service to post on the developer's internet website documentation regarding the data used by the developer to train the generative artificial intelligence system or service, as prescribed.

### New Provisions - Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA)

This bill would enact the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA) that would, among other things related to ensuring the safety of a foundation model, as defined, developed by a frontier developer, require a large frontier developer to write, implement, and clearly and conspicuously publish on its internet website a frontier AI framework that applies to the large frontier developer's frontier models and describes how the large frontier developer approaches, among other things, incorporating national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices into its frontier AI framework.

The TFAIA would also require a large frontier developer to transmit to the Office of Emergency Services a summary of any assessment of catastrophic risk, as defined, resulting from internal use of its frontier models, as specified. The TFAIA would require the Office of Emergency Services to establish a mechanism to be used by a frontier developer or a member of the public to report, as prescribed, a critical safety incident, as defined, and would also require the Office of Emergency Services to establish a mechanism to be used by a large frontier developer to confidentially submit summaries of any assessments of the potential for catastrophic risk resulting from internal use of its frontier models, as prescribed.

The TFAIA would exempt from the California Public Records Act a report of a critical safety incident submitted to the Office of Emergency Services, a report of assessments of catastrophic risk from internet use, and a covered employee report made pursuant to the whistleblower protections described below.

The TFAIA would impose a civil penalty for noncompliance with the TFAIA to be enforced by the Attorney General, as prescribed.

### (2) CalCompute Consortium

Existing law establishes the Department of Technology within the Government Operations Agency. Existing law requires the department to conduct, in coordination with other interagency bodies as it deems appropriate, a comprehensive inventory of all high-risk automated decision systems that have been proposed for use, development, or procurement by, or are being used, developed, or procured by, any state agency.

This bill would establish within the Government Operations Agency a consortium required to develop a framework for the creation of a public cloud computing cluster to be known as "CalCompute" that advances the development and deployment of artificial intelligence that is safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable by, among other things, fostering research and innovation that benefits the public, as prescribed. The bill would require the Government Operations Agency to, on or before January 1, 2027, submit a report from the consortium to the Legislature with that framework and would dissolve the consortium upon submission of that report. The bill would make those provisions operative only upon an appropriation in a budget act, or other measure, for its purposes.

### (3) Whistleblower Protections

Existing law prohibits employers and their agents from making, adopting, or enforcing a rule, regulation, or policy preventing an employee from disclosing information to certain entities or from providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a law, as specified, and prohibits retaliation against an employee for, among other things, exercising these rights.

This bill would, among other things related to protecting whistleblowers working with foundation models, prohibit a frontier developer from making, adopting, enforcing, or entering into a rule, regulation, policy, or contract that prevents a covered employee, as defined, from disclosing, or retaliates against a covered employee for disclosing, information to the Attorney General, a federal authority, a person with authority over the covered employee, or another covered employee who has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the reported issue, if the covered employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses that the frontier developer's activities pose a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk or that the frontier developer has violated the TFAIA.

This bill would require a large frontier developer to provide a certain internal process through which a covered employee may anonymously disclose information to the large frontier developer if the covered employee believes in good faith that the information indicates that the large frontier developer's activities present a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk or that the large frontier developer violated the TFAIA. The bill would specify provisions particular to the enforcement of those whistleblower protections and would authorize attorney's fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action for a violation.

This bill would preempt any rule, regulation, code, ordinance, or other law adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency on or after January 1, 2025, specifically related to the regulation of frontier developers with respect to their management of catastrophic risk.

Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.

## Bill Text

### The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

## SECTION 1. Legislative Findings and Declarations

The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(a) California is leading the world in artificial intelligence innovation and research through companies large and small and through the state's remarkable public and private universities.

(b) Artificial intelligence, including new advances in foundation models, has the potential to catalyze innovation and the rapid development of a wide range of benefits for Californians and the California economy, including advances in medicine, wildfire forecasting and prevention, and climate science, and to push the bounds of human creativity and capacity.

(c) The Joint California Policy Working Group on AI Frontier Models has recommended sound principles for policy in artificial intelligence.

(d) Targeted interventions to support effective artificial intelligence governance should balance the technology's benefits and the potential for material risks.

(e) In building a robust and transparent evidence environment, policymakers can align incentives to simultaneously protect consumers, leverage industry expertise, and recognize leading safety practices.

(f) As industry actors conduct internal research on their technologies' impacts, public trust in these technologies would significantly benefit from access to information regarding, and increased awareness of, frontier AI capabilities.

(g) Greater transparency can also advance accountability, competition, and public trust.

(h) Whistleblower protections and public-facing information sharing are key instruments to increase transparency.

(i) Incident reporting systems enable monitoring of the post-deployment impacts of artificial intelligence.

(j) Unless they are developed with careful diligence and reasonable precaution, there is concern that advanced artificial intelligence systems could have capabilities that pose catastrophic risks from both malicious uses and malfunctions, including artificial intelligence-enabled hacking, biological attacks, and loss of control.

(k) With the frontier of artificial intelligence rapidly evolving, there is a need for legislation to track the frontier of artificial intelligence research and alert policymakers and the public to serious risks and harms from the very most advanced artificial intelligence systems, while avoiding burdening smaller companies behind the frontier.

(l) While the major artificial intelligence developers have already voluntarily established the creation, use, and publication of frontier AI frameworks as an industry best practice, not all developers are providing reporting that is consistent and sufficient to ensure necessary transparency and protection of the public. Mandatory, standardized, and objective reporting by frontier developers is required to provide the government and the public with timely and accurate information.

(m) Timely reporting of critical safety incidents to the government is essential to ensure that public authorities are promptly informed of ongoing and emerging risks to public safety. This reporting enables the government to monitor, assess, and respond effectively in the event that advanced capabilities emerge in frontier artificial intelligence models that may pose a threat to the public.

(n) In the future, foundation models developed by smaller companies or that are behind the frontier may pose significant catastrophic risk, and additional legislation may be needed at that time.

(o) The recent release of the Governor's California Report on Frontier AI Policy and testimony from legislative hearings on artificial intelligence before the Legislature reflect the advances in AI model capabilities that could pose potential catastrophic risk in frontier artificial intelligence, which this act aims to address.

(p) It is the intent of the Legislature to create more transparency, but collective safety will depend in part on frontier developers taking due care in their development and deployment of frontier models proportional to the scale of the foreseeable risks.

A frontier developer shall not make, adopt, enforce, or enter into a rule, regulation, policy, or contract that prevents a covered employee from disclosing, or retaliates against a covered employee for disclosing, information to the Attorney General, a federal authority, a person with authority over the covered employee, or another covered employee who has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the reported issue, if the covered employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses either of the following:

(1) The frontier developer's activities pose a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk.

(2) The frontier developer has violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code.

**(b) Contract Protections**

A frontier developer shall not enter into a contract that prevents a covered employee from making a disclosure protected under Section 1102.5.

**(c) Hotline Access**

A covered employee may use the hotline described in Section 1102.7 to make reports described in subdivision (a).

**(d) Employee Notification**

A frontier developer shall provide a clear notice to all covered employees of their rights and responsibilities under this section, including by doing either of the following:

(1) At all times posting and displaying within any workplace maintained by the frontier developer a notice to all covered employees of their rights under this section, ensuring that any new covered employee receives equivalent notice, and ensuring that any covered employee who works remotely periodically receives an equivalent notice.

(2) At least once each year, providing written notice to each covered employee of the covered employee's rights under this section and ensuring that the notice is received and acknowledged by all of those covered employees.

**(e) Internal Reporting Process**

(1) A large frontier developer shall provide a reasonable internal process through which a covered employee may anonymously disclose information to the large frontier developer if the covered employee believes in good faith that the information indicates that the large frontier developer's activities present a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk or that the large frontier developer violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, including a monthly update to the person who made the disclosure regarding the status of the large frontier developer's investigation of the disclosure and the actions taken by the large frontier developer in response to the disclosure.

(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the disclosures and responses of the process required by this subdivision shall be shared with officers and directors of the large frontier developer at least once each quarter.

(B) If a covered employee has alleged wrongdoing by an officer or director of the large frontier developer in a disclosure or response, subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to that officer or director.

**(f) Attorney's Fees**

The court is authorized to award reasonable attorney's fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action for a violation of this section.

**(g) Burden of Proof**

In a civil action brought pursuant to this section, once it has been demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that an activity proscribed by this section was a contributing factor in the alleged prohibited action against the covered employee, the frontier developer shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged action would have occurred for legitimate, independent reasons even if the covered employee had not engaged in activities protected by this section.

**(h) Injunctive Relief**

(1) In a civil action or administrative proceeding brought pursuant to this section, a covered employee may petition the superior court in any county wherein the violation in question is alleged to have occurred, or wherein the person resides or transacts business, for appropriate temporary or preliminary injunctive relief.

(2) Upon the filing of the petition for injunctive relief, the petitioner shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person, and thereupon the court shall have jurisdiction to grant temporary injunctive relief as the court deems just and proper.

(3) In addition to any harm resulting directly from a violation of this section, the court shall consider the chilling effect on other covered employees asserting their rights under this section in determining whether temporary injunctive relief is just and proper.

(4) Appropriate injunctive relief shall be issued on a showing that reasonable cause exists to believe a violation has occurred.

(5) An order authorizing temporary injunctive relief shall remain in effect until an administrative or judicial determination or citation has been issued, or until the completion of a review pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 98.74, whichever is longer, or at a certain time set by the court. Thereafter, a preliminary or permanent injunction may be issued if it is shown to be just and proper. Any temporary injunctive relief shall not prohibit a frontier developer from disciplining or terminating a covered employee for conduct that is unrelated to the claim of the retaliation.

**(i) Appeal**

Notwithstanding Section 916 of the Code of Civil Procedure, injunctive relief granted pursuant to this section shall not be stayed pending appeal.

**(j) Cumulative Remedies**

(1) This section does not impair or limit the applicability of Section 1102.5, including with respect to the rights of employees who are not covered employees to report violations of this chapter or Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code.

(2) The remedies provided by this section are cumulative to each other and the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.

## SECTION 6. Constitutional Findings

The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, imposes a limitation on the public's right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:

Information in critical safety incident reports, assessments of risks from internal use, and reports from covered employees may contain information that could threaten public safety or compromise the response to an incident if disclosed to the public.
