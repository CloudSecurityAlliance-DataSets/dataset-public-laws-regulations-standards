# Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (CUBI)

## Overview
The Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (CUBI), found in Texas Business & Commerce Code Chapter 503, regulates the collection and use of biometric identifiers in Texas. Enacted in 2009, CUBI provides protections for biometric information, though it is less comprehensive than Illinois BIPA.

## Key Definitions

### Biometric Identifier
- **Retina or Iris Scan**: Eye-based biometric identification
- **Fingerprint**: Fingerprint-based identification systems
- **Voiceprint**: Voice recognition and authentication
- **Record of Hand or Face Geometry**: Geometric analysis of hands or faces

### Covered Entities
- **All Persons**: Individuals and entities operating in Texas
- **Commercial Entities**: Businesses collecting biometric identifiers
- **Government Entities**: Limited coverage for government biometric collection

## Core Requirements

### Notice Requirements
- **Notification**: Must inform individuals before collecting biometric identifiers
- **Purpose Disclosure**: Must disclose purpose of biometric collection
- **Consent**: Generally requires consent for biometric collection
- **Retention Policy**: Must establish retention and destruction schedule

### Information Practices
- **Storage Requirements**: Must store biometric identifiers securely
- **Disclosure Restrictions**: Limited disclosure to third parties
- **Destruction Requirements**: Must destroy biometric identifiers according to schedule
- **Reasonable Care**: Must exercise reasonable care in protecting biometric identifiers

## AI and Cloud Applications

### Facial Recognition Systems
- **AI-Powered Face Recognition**: Covered by CUBI requirements
- **Cloud-Based Services**: Cloud facial recognition services must comply
- **Employee Systems**: Workplace facial recognition systems
- **Customer Applications**: Retail and service facial recognition

### Biometric Authentication
- **Access Control**: Biometric building and system access
- **Device Authentication**: Biometric device and application authentication
- **Payment Systems**: Biometric payment processing systems
- **Security Systems**: Biometric security and surveillance systems

## Enforcement and Penalties

### Civil Penalties
- **Statutory Damages**: Up to $25,000 per violation
- **Injunctive Relief**: Court orders to stop violations
- **Attorney's Fees**: Potential recovery of attorney's fees
- **Civil Lawsuits**: Private right of action for violations

- **Consent Management**: Obtaining and documenting consent
- **Data Protection**: Securing biometric identifier storage and transmission
- **Destruction Schedules**: Implementing biometric data destruction policies

### Documentation
- **Policy Documentation**: Written biometric identifier policies
- **Consent Records**: Maintaining records of biometric consent
- **Security Documentation**: Documenting biometric security measures
- **Compliance Training**: Training staff on CUBI requirements

## Business Impact

### Compliance Considerations
- **System Design**: Designing biometric systems for CUBI compliance
- **Vendor Selection**: Choosing CUBI-compliant technology vendors
- **Process Changes**: Modifying business processes for compliance
- **Risk Management**: Managing CUBI compliance and litigation risks

### Industry Applications
