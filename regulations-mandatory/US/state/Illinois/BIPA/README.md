# Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)

## Overview
The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), enacted in 2008 and effective October 1, 2008, is the nation's strongest biometric privacy law. BIPA regulates the collection, use, and storage of biometric identifiers and information, providing significant protections and private rights of action for violations.

## Key Definitions
