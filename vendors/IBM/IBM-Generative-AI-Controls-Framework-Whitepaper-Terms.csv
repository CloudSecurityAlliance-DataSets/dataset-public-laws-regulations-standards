Term,,Definition,,,,,,,
Accountability,,"This term refers to the idea that one is responsible for their action – and as a corollary their consequence – and must be able to explain their aims, motivations, and reasons.",,,,,,,
Accuracy,,"The concept of accuracy of AI systems generally refers to the capability of the AI system to perform the task for which it has been designed. This includes, inter alia, making correct predictions about future outcomes, correctly classifying inputs, regrouping profiles into relevant categories, or generating faithful examples from abstract descriptions.",,,,,,,
AI Lifecycle,,"The iterative process of moving a business problem to an AI solution that solves the problem. It encompasses Designing a solution based on the problem to be solved, Developing and evaluating the AI solution that solves the problem, and Deploying and monitoring the AI solution to ensure it achieves the business objectives in a trustworthy, secure manner.",,,,,,,
AI Model,,"An algorithm built with AI techniques, typically machine learning, to perform tasks.",,,,,,,
AI System,,"“A machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments,” as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. An AI system is a complete application deployed to accomplish a specific function. AI systems are made up of a variety of components, including an AI model, additional training and data, tooling, and other modification and customization.",,,,,,,
Artificial Intelligence (AI),,AI is a field of computer science focused on leveraging computers and machines to solve problems commonly understood to require human intelligence,,,,,,,
Bias,,"Bias (in AI) is an anomaly in the output of AI systems, due to the prejudices and/or erroneous assumptions made during the system development process or prejudices in the training data, so the results from the AI system cannot be generalized widely.",,,,,,,
Ethical AI,,"Term used to indicate the development, deployment and use of AI that ensures compliance with ethical norms, including fundamental rights as special moral entitlements, ethical principles, and related core values.",,,,,,,
Explainability,,Feature of an AI system that is intelligible to non-experts. An AI system is intelligible if its functionality and operations can be explained non technically to a person not skilled in the art.,,,,,,,
Foundational Model,,"An AI model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. Foundation models are typically large-scale (e.g., billions of parameters) models trained on unlabeled data using self- supervision. While all foundation models are built using generative AI, and therefore have the capability to generate content, they can be used in ways that do not use this capability. Foundation models are sometimes called “general-purpose AI.”",,,,,,,
Generative AI (Gen AI),,"AI techniques capable of generating content or data of various kinds, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, 3D objects, videos, or other artifacts.",,,,,,,
Hallucination,,"Generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the provided source content. There are two main types of hallucinations, namely intrinsic hallucination and extrinsic hallucination. An intrinsic hallucination is a generated output that contradicts the source content; an extrinsic hallucination is a generated output that cannot be verified from the source content (i.e., output can neither be supported nor contradicted by the source).",,,,,,,
Inferencing,,Inferencing is the process of running data through a trained AI model to make a prediction or solve a task.,,,,,,,
LLM App / FM App,,"A special type of AI System which makes use of Large Language Models (LLMs), or Foundation models in general, to solve a business problem.  These systems typically use some common components such as vector databases, embedding models, data chunking strategies, etc.",,,,,,,
Model Drift,,The change in model input data that leads to model accuracy or performance degradation.,,,,,,,
Model Poisoning,,"Model poisoning occurs when an adversarial actor attacks an AI system and is able to inject bad data into the AI model’s training set, thus making the AI system learn something that it should not learn.",,,,,,,
Model Training,,The phase in the data science development lifecycle where practitioners try to fit the best combination of weights and bias to a machine learning algorithm to minimize a loss function over the prediction range.,,,,,,,
Prompt Engineering,,Prompt engineering is the process of crafting prompt text to best effect for a given model and parameters.,,,,,,,
RAG,,RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation and is a common type of LLM based application.  This allows clients to use Foundation Models to answer user questions using client specific data.,,,,,,,
RAG Metrics,,"Metrics used to compute the quality of a RAG application. This include 3 types of metrics: Faithfulness, Context Relevance and Answer Relevance which measure different aspects of the RAG application quality.",,,,,,,
Responsible AI,,An AI system that aligns development and behavior to goals and values. This includes developing and fielding AI technology in a manner that is consistent with democratic values.,,,,,,,
Transparency,,Transparency reflects the extent to which information about an AI system and its outputs is available to individuals interacting with such a system – regardless of whether they are even aware that they are doing so.,,,,,,,
