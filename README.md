# Dataset of public Laws, Regulations, and Standards

This is a public data set of Laws, Regulations, and Standards.

## Conmversion from PDF to Markdown

This is mostly done using [marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker) with the command:

```
marker_single file.pdf ./ --ocr_all_pages
```

We use "--ocr_all_pages" because a lot of these documents include tables.
