## 1. **Introduction**

This document is a cross-sectoral profile of and companion resource for the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) for Generative AI,
1 pursuant to President Biden's Executive Order (EO) 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.2 The AI RMF was released in January 2023, and is intended for voluntary use and to improve the ability of organizations to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems. 

A *profile* is an implementation of the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories for a specific setting, application, or technology - in this case, Generative AI (GAI) - based on the requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the Framework user. AI RMF profiles assist organizations in deciding how to best manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory requirements and best practices, and reflects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF profiles, this profile offers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle and for GAI as a technology. As GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document is an AI RMF cross-sectoral profile. Cross-sectoral profiles can be used to govern, map, measure, and manage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of large language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. This document defines risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and describing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, map, measure, and manage these risks.

1 EO 14110 defines Generative AI as "the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input data in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content." While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers to generative foundation models. The foundation model subcategory of "dual-use foundation models" is defined by EO 14110 as "an AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of billions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts." 
2 This profile was developed per Section 4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110, which directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop a companion resource to the AI RMF, NIST AI 100â€“1, for generative AI.
This work was informed by public feedback and consultations with diverse stakeholder groups as part of NIST's Generative AI Public Working Group (GAI PWG). The GAI PWG was an open, transparent, and collaborative process, facilitated via a virtual workspace, to obtain multistakeholder input on GAI risk management and to inform NIST's approach. The focus of the GAI PWG was limited to four primary considerations relevant to GAI: Governance, Content Provenance, Pre-deployment Testing, and Incident Disclosure (further described in Appendix A). As such, the suggested actions in this document primarily address these considerations. Future revisions of this profile will include additional AI RMF subcategories, risks, and suggested actions based on additional considerations of GAI as the space evolves and empirical evidence indicates additional risks. A glossary of terms pertinent to GAI risk management will be developed and hosted on NIST's Trustworthy & 
Responsible AI Resource Center (AIRC), and added to The Language of Trustworthy AI: An In-Depth Glossary of Terms. This document was also informed by public comments and consultations from several Requests for Information.

## 2. **Overview Of Risks Unique To Or Exacerbated By Gai**

In the context of the AI RMF, *risk* refers to the composite measure of an event's **probability** (or likelihood) of occurring and the **magnitude** or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. 

Some risks can be assessed as likely to materialize in a given context, particularly those that have been empirically demonstrated in similar contexts. Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given context, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain. AI risks can differ from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI risks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions:
- **Stage of the AI lifecycle:** Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, and/or decommissioning. 

- **Scope:** Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation levels (i.e., for a specific use case), or at the ecosystem level - that is, beyond a single system or organizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of "algorithmic monocultures, 3" resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to opportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.

4
- **Source of risk:** Risks may emerge from factors related to the design, training, or operation of the GAI model itself, stemming in some cases from GAI model or system inputs, and in other cases, from GAI system outputs. Many GAI risks, however, originate from human behavior, including 

3 "Algorithmic monocultures" refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm in consequential decision-making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility by systems to correlated failures (like unexpected shocks), due to multiple actors relying on the same algorithm. 4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and labor markets. Fewer studies have examined the impact of GAI on the labor market, though some industry surveys indicate that that both employees and employers are pondering this disruption. 
the abuse, misuse, and unsafe repurposing by humans (adversarial or not), and others result from interactions between a human and an AI system.

- Time **scale:** GAI risks may materialize abruptly or across extended periods. Examples include immediate (and/or prolonged) emotional harm and potential risks to physical safety due to the distribution of harmful deepfake images, or the long-term effect of disinformation on societal trust in public institutions. 

The presence of risks and where they fall along the dimensions above will vary depending on the characteristics of the GAI model, system, or use case at hand. These characteristics include but are not limited to GAI model or system architecture, training mechanisms and libraries, data types used for training or fine-tuning, levels of model access or availability of model weights, and application or use case context. Organizations may choose to tailor how they measure GAI risks based on these characteristics. They may additionally wish to allocate risk management resources relative to the severity and likelihood of negative impacts, including where and how these risks manifest, and their direct and material impacts harms in the context of GAI use. Mitigations for model or system level risks may differ from mitigations for use-case or ecosystem level risks. Importantly, some GAI risks are unknown, and are therefore difficult to properly scope or evaluate given the uncertainty about potential GAI scale, complexity, and capabilities. Other risks may be known but difficult to estimate given the wide range of GAI stakeholders, uses, inputs, and outputs. Challenges with risk estimation are aggravated by a lack of visibility into GAI training data, and the generally immature state of the science of AI measurement and safety today. This document focuses on risks for which there is an existing empirical evidence base at the time this profile was written; for example, speculative risks that may potentially arise in more advanced, future GAI systems are not considered. Future updates may incorporate additional risks or provide further details on the risks identified below. To guide organizations in identifying and managing GAI risks, a set of risks unique to or exacerbated by the development and use of GAI are defined below.5 Each risk is labeled according to the outcome, object, or source of the risk (i.e., some are risks "to" a subject or domain and others are risks "of" or "from" an issue or theme). These risks provide a lens through which organizations can frame and execute risk management efforts. To help streamline risk management efforts, each risk is mapped in Section 3 (as well as in tables in Appendix B) to relevant Trustworthy AI Characteristics identified in the AI RMF.

 

5 These risks can be further categorized by organizations depending on their unique approaches to risk definition and management. One possible way to further categorize these risks, derived in part from the UK's International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, could be: **1) Technical / Model risks (or risk from malfunction):** 
Confabulation; Dangerous or Violent Recommendations; Data Privacy; Value Chain and Component Integration; Harmful Bias, and Homogenization; **2) Misuse by humans (or malicious use):** CBRN Information or Capabilities; Data Privacy; Human-AI Configuration; Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content; Information Integrity; Information Security; **3) Ecosystem / societal risks (or systemic risks)**: Data Privacy; Environmental; Intellectual Property. We also note that some risks are cross-cutting between these categories. 
1. CBRN Information **or Capabilities**: Eased access to or synthesis of materially nefarious information or design capabilities related to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons or other dangerous materials or agents. 

2. **Confabulation:** The production of confidently stated but erroneous or false content (known colloquially as "hallucinations" or "fabrications") by which users may be misled or deceived.

6 3. Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful **Content:** Eased production of and access to violent, inciting, radicalizing, or threatening content as well as recommendations to carry out self-harm or conduct illegal activities. Includes difficulty controlling public exposure to hateful and disparaging or stereotyping content. 

4. **Data Privacy:** Impacts due to leakage and unauthorized use, disclosure, or de-anonymization of biometric, health, location, or other personally identifiable information or sensitive data.

7 5. **Environmental Impacts:** Impacts due to high compute resource utilization in training or operating GAI models, and related outcomes that may adversely impact ecosystems. 

6. Harmful Bias or **Homogenization:** Amplification and exacerbation of historical, societal, and systemic biases; performance disparities8 between sub-groups or languages, possibly due to non-representative training data, that result in discrimination, amplification of biases, or incorrect presumptions about performance; undesired homogeneity that skews system or model outputs, which may be erroneous, lead to ill-founded decision-making, or amplify harmful biases. 

7. Human-**AI Configuration:** Arrangements of or interactions between a human and an AI system which can result in the human inappropriately anthropomorphizing GAI systems or experiencing algorithmic aversion, automation bias, over-reliance, or emotional entanglement with GAI systems. 

8. **Information Integrity:** Lowered barrier to entry to generate and support the exchange and consumption of content which may not distinguish fact from opinion or fiction or acknowledge uncertainties, or could be leveraged for large-scale dis- and mis-information campaigns.

9. **Information Security:** Lowered barriers for offensive cyber capabilities, including via automated discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities to ease hacking, malware, phishing, offensive cyber 

6 Some commenters have noted that the terms "hallucination" and "fabrication" anthropomorphize GAI, which itself is a risk related to GAI systems as it can inappropriately attribute human characteristics to non-human entities. 

7 What is categorized as sensitive data or sensitive PII can be highly contextual based on the nature of the information, but examples of sensitive information include information that relates to an information subject's most intimate sphere, including political opinions, sex life, or criminal convictions. 8 The notion of harm presumes some baseline scenario that the harmful factor (e.g., a GAI model) makes worse. 

When the mechanism for potential harm is a disparity between groups, it can be difficult to establish what the most appropriate baseline is to compare against, which can result in divergent views on when a disparity between AI behaviors for different subgroups constitutes a harm. In discussing harms from disparities such as biased behavior, this document highlights examples where someone's situation is worsened relative to what it would have been in the absence of any AI system, making the outcome unambiguously a harm of the system. 
operations, or other cyberattacks; increased attack surface for targeted cyberattacks, which may compromise a system's availability or the confidentiality or integrity of training data, code, or model weights. 

10. **Intellectual Property:** Eased production or replication of alleged copyrighted, trademarked, or licensed content without authorization (possibly in situations which do not fall under fair use); eased exposure of trade secrets; or plagiarism or illegal replication. 

11. **Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content:** Eased production of and access to obscene, degrading, and/or abusive imagery which can cause harm, including synthetic child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) of adults. 

12. **Value Chain and Component Integration**: Non-transparent or untraceable integration of upstream third-party components, including data that has been improperly obtained or not processed and cleaned due to increased automation from GAI; improper supplier vetting across the AI lifecycle; or other issues that diminish transparency or accountability for downstream users.

## 2.1. Cbrn Information **Or Capabilities**

In the future, GAI may enable malicious actors to more easily access CBRN weapons and/or relevant knowledge, information, materials, tools, or technologies that could be misused to assist in the design, development, production, or use of CBRN weapons or other dangerous materials or agents. While relevant biological and chemical threat knowledge and information is often publicly accessible, LLMs could facilitate its analysis or synthesis, particularly by individuals without formal scientific training or expertise. Recent research on this topic found that LLM outputs regarding biological threat creation and attack planning provided minimal assistance beyond traditional search engine queries, suggesting that state-ofthe-art LLMs at the time these studies were conducted do not substantially increase the operational likelihood of such an attack. The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or biological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and infrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key barriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI can help actors address those barriers. Furthermore, chemical and biological design tools (BDTs) - highly specialized AI systems trained on scientific data that aid in chemical and biological design - may augment design capabilities in chemistry and biology beyond what text-based LLMs are able to provide. As these models become more efficacious, including for beneficial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for harm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents. While some of these described capabilities lie beyond the reach of existing GAI tools, ongoing assessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both the ability of AI tools to facilitate CBRN weapons planning and GAI systems' connection or access to relevant data and tools. 

Trustworthy AI **Characteristic**: Safe, Explainable and Interpretable

## 2.2. **Confabulation**

"Confabulation" refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and confidently present erroneous or false content in response to prompts. Confabulations also include generated outputs that diverge from the prompts or other input or that contradict previously generated statements in the same context. These phenomena are colloquially also referred to as "hallucinations" or "fabrications." Confabulations can occur across GAI outputs and contexts.

9,10 Confabulations are a natural result of the way generative models are designed: they generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution of their training data; for example, LLMs predict the next token or word in a sentence or phrase. While such statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce outputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This dynamic is particularly relevant when it comes to open-ended prompts for long-form responses and in domains which require highly contextual and/or domain expertise. 

Risks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content - often due to the confident nature of the response - leading users to act upon or promote the false information. This poses a challenge for many real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient information reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong treatments. Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI into applications involving consequential decision making. GAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the system's answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system's output. For instance, LLMs sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the answer itself is incorrect. Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, potentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human. The extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the potential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study. Given the wide range of downstream impacts of GAI, it is difficult to estimate the downstream scale and impact of confabulations.

## 2.3. Dangerous, Violent, Or Hateful **Content**

GAI systems can produce content that is inciting, radicalizing, or threatening, or that glorifies violence, with greater ease and scale than other technologies. LLMs have been reported to generate dangerous or violent recommendations, and some models have generated actionable instructions for dangerous or 

9 Confabulations of falsehoods are most commonly a problem for text-based outputs; for audio, image, or video content, creative generation of non-factual content can be a desired behavior. 10 For example, legal confabulations have been shown to be pervasive in current state-of-the-art LLMs. See also, e.g., 
unethical behavior. Text-to-image models also make it easy to create images that could be used to promote dangerous or violent messages. Similar concerns are present for other GAI media, including video and audio. GAI may also produce content that recommends self-harm or criminal/illegal activities. Many current systems restrict model outputs to limit certain content or in response to certain prompts, but this approach may still produce harmful recommendations in response to other less-explicit, novel prompts (also relevant to CBRN Information or Capabilities, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Obscene, Degrading and/or Abusive Content). Crafting such prompts deliberately is known as "jailbreaking," or, manipulating prompts to circumvent output controls. Limitations of GAI systems can be harmful or dangerous in certain contexts. Studies have observed that users may disclose mental health issues in conversations with chatbots - and that users exhibit negative reactions to unhelpful responses from these chatbots during situations of distress. 

This risk encompasses difficulty controlling creation of and public exposure to offensive or hateful language, and denigrating or stereotypical content generated by AI. This kind of speech may contribute to downstream harm such as fueling dangerous or violent behaviors. The spread of denigrating or stereotypical content can also further exacerbate representational harms (see Harmful Bias and Homogenization below). 

Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Safe, Secure and Resilient

## 2.4. **Data Privacy**

GAI systems raise several risks to privacy. GAI system training requires large volumes of data, which in some cases may include personal data. The use of personal data for GAI training raises risks to widely accepted privacy principles, including to transparency, individual participation (including consent), and purpose specification. For example, most model developers do not disclose specific data sources on which models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identifiably information (PII) was trained on and, if so, how it was collected. Models may leak, generate, or correctly infer sensitive information about individuals. For example, during adversarial attacks, LLMs have revealed sensitive information (from the public domain) that was included in their training data. This problem has been referred to as data memorization, and may pose exacerbated privacy risks even for data present only in a small number of training samples. In addition to revealing sensitive information in GAI training data, GAI models may be able to correctly infer PII or sensitive data that was not in their training data nor disclosed by the user by stitching together information from disparate sources. These inferences can have negative impact on an individual even if the inferences are not accurate (e.g., confabulations), and especially if they reveal information that the individual considers sensitive or that is used to disadvantage or harm them. Beyond harms from information exposure (such as extortion or dignitary harm), wrong or inappropriate inferences of PII can contribute to downstream or secondary harmful impacts. For example, predictive inferences made by GAI models based on PII or protected attributes can contribute to adverse decisions, leading to representational or allocative harms to individuals or groups (see Harmful Bias and Homogenization below). 

Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient

## 2.5. **Environmental Impacts**

Training, maintaining, and operating (running inference on) GAI systems are resource-intensive activities, with potentially large energy and environmental footprints. Energy and carbon emissions vary based on what is being done with the GAI model (i.e., pre-training, fine-tuning, inference), the modality of the content, hardware used, and type of task or application. 

Current estimates suggest that training a single transformer LLM can emit as much carbon as 300 roundtrip flights between San Francisco and New York. In a study comparing energy consumption and carbon emissions for LLM inference, generative tasks (e.g., text summarization) were found to be more energyand carbon-intensive than discriminative or non-generative tasks (e.g., text classification). 

Methods for creating smaller versions of trained models, such as model distillation or compression, could reduce environmental impacts at inference time, but training and tuning such models may still contribute to their environmental impacts. Currently there is no agreed upon method to estimate environmental impacts from GAI. 

Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Safe

## 2.6. **Harmful Bias And Homogenization**

Bias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in automated systems. AI systems, including GAI systems, can increase the speed and scale at which harmful biases manifest and are acted upon, potentially perpetuating and amplifying harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society. For example, when prompted to generate images of CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and judges, current text-to-image models underrepresent women and/or racial minorities, and people with disabilities. Image generator models have also produced biased or stereotyped output for various demographic groups and have difficulty producing non-stereotyped content even when the prompt specifically requests image features that are inconsistent with the stereotypes. Harmful bias in GAI models, which may stem from their training data, can also cause representational harms or perpetuate or exacerbate bias based on race, gender, disability, or other protected classes. Harmful bias in GAI systems can also lead to harms via disparities between how a model performs for different subgroups or languages (e.g., an LLM may perform less well for non-English languages or certain dialects). Such disparities can contribute to discriminatory decision-making or amplification of existing societal biases. In addition, GAI systems may be inappropriately trusted to perform similarly across all subgroups, which could leave the groups facing underperformance with worse outcomes than if no GAI system were used. Disparate or reduced performance for lower-resource languages also presents challenges to model adoption, inclusion, and accessibility, and may make preservation of endangered languages more difficult if GAI systems become embedded in everyday processes that would otherwise have been opportunities to use these languages. Bias is mutually reinforcing with the problem of undesired homogenization, in which GAI systems produce skewed distributions of outputs that are overly uniform (for example, repetitive aesthetic styles and reduced content diversity). Overly homogenized outputs can themselves be incorrect, or they may lead to unreliable decision-making or amplify harmful biases. These phenomena can flow from foundation models to downstream models and systems, with the foundation models acting as "bottlenecks," or single points of failure. Overly homogenized content can contribute to "model collapse." Model collapse can occur when model training over-relies on synthetic data, resulting in data points disappearing from the distribution of the new model's outputs. In addition to threatening the robustness of the model overall, model collapse could lead to homogenized outputs, including by amplifying any homogenization from the model used to generate the synthetic training data.

## 2.7. **Human-Ai Configuration**

GAI system use can involve varying risks of misconfigurations and poor interactions between a system and a human who is interacting with it. Humans bring their unique perspectives, experiences, or domain-specific expertise to interactions with AI systems but may not have detailed knowledge of AI systems and how they work. As a result, human experts may be unnecessarily "averse" to GAI systems, and thus deprive themselves or others of GAI's beneficial uses. Conversely, due to the complexity and increasing reliability of GAI technology, over time, humans may over-rely on GAI systems or may unjustifiably perceive GAI content to be of higher quality than that produced by other sources. This phenomenon is an example of automation bias, or excessive deference to automated systems. Automation bias can exacerbate other risks of GAI, such as risks of confabulation or risks of bias or homogenization. There may also be concerns about emotional entanglement between humans and GAI systems, which could lead to negative psychological impacts.

## 2.8. **Information Integrity**

Information integrity describes the "spectrum of information and associated patterns of its creation, exchange, and consumption in society." High-integrity information can be trusted; "distinguishes fact from fiction, opinion, and inference; acknowledges uncertainties; and is transparent about its level of vetting. This information can be linked to the original source(s) with appropriate evidence. High-integrity information is also accurate and reliable, can be verified and authenticated, has a clear chain of custody, and creates reasonable expectations about when its validity may expire."11

11 This definition of information integrity is derived from the 2022 White House Roadmap for Researchers on Priorities Related to Information Integrity Research and Development. 
GAI systems can ease the unintentional production or dissemination of false, inaccurate, or misleading content (misinformation) at scale, particularly if the content stems from confabulations. GAI systems can also ease the deliberate production or dissemination of false or misleading information (disinformation) at scale, where an actor has the explicit intent to deceive or cause harm to others. Even very subtle changes to text or images can manipulate human and machine perception. Similarly, GAI systems could enable a higher degree of sophistication for malicious actors to produce disinformation that is targeted towards specific demographics. Current and emerging multimodal models make it possible to generate both text-based disinformation and highly realistic "deepfakes" - that is, synthetic audiovisual content and photorealistic images.12 Additional disinformation threats could be enabled by future GAI models trained on new data modalities. Disinformation and misinformation - both of which may be facilitated by GAI - may erode public trust in true or valid evidence and information, with downstream effects. For example, a synthetic image of a Pentagon blast went viral and briefly caused a drop in the stock market. Generative AI models can also assist malicious actors in creating compelling imagery and propaganda to support disinformation campaigns, which may not be photorealistic, but could enable these campaigns to gain more reach and engagement on social media platforms. Additionally, generative AI models can assist malicious actors in creating fraudulent content intended to impersonate others.

## 2.9. **Information Security**

Information security for computer systems and data is a mature field with widely accepted and standardized practices for offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two primary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by lowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of offensive capabilities; simultaneously, it expands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data poisoning. 

Offensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as hacking, malware, and phishing. Reports have indicated that LLMs are already able to discover some vulnerabilities in systems (hardware, software, data) and write code to exploit them. Sophisticated threat actors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of the attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate privileges after gaining system access. Information security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system and the integrity and (when applicable) the confidentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model weights. To identify and secure potential attack points in AI systems or specific components of the AI

value chain (e.g., data inputs, processing, GAI training, or deployment environments), conventional cybersecurity practices may need to adapt or evolve. For instance, prompt injection involves modifying what input is provided to a GAI system so that it behaves in unintended ways. In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious prompts and input them directly to a GAI system, with a variety of downstream negative consequences to interconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit vulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely querying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model. Another cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training dataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation. Malicious tampering with data or parts of the model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs.

## 2.10. **Intellectual Property**

Intellectual property risks from GAI systems may arise where the use of copyrighted works is not a fair use under the fair use doctrine. If a GAI system's training data included copyrighted material, GAI outputs displaying instances of training data memorization (see Data Privacy above) could infringe on copyright. How GAI relates to copyright, including the status of generated content that is similar to but does not strictly copy work protected by copyright, is currently being debated in legal fora. Similar discussions are taking place regarding the use or emulation of personal identity, likeness, or voice without permission.

## 2.11. **Obscene, Degrading, And/Or Abusive Content**

GAI can ease the production of and access to illegal non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) of adults, and/or child sexual abuse material (CSAM). GAI-generated obscene, abusive or degrading content can create privacy, psychological and emotional, and even physical harms, and in some cases may be illegal. Generated explicit or obscene AI content may include highly realistic "deepfakes" of real individuals, including children. The spread of this kind of material can have downstream negative consequences: in the context of CSAM, even if the generated images do not resemble specific individuals, the prevalence of such images can divert time and resources from efforts to find real-world victims. Outside of CSAM, the creation and spread of NCII disproportionately impacts women and sexual minorities, and can have subsequent negative consequences including decline in overall mental health, substance abuse, and even suicidal thoughts. Data used for training GAI models may unintentionally include CSAM and NCII. A recent report noted that several commonly used GAI training datasets were found to contain hundreds of known images of CSAM. Even when trained on "clean" data, increasingly capable GAI models can synthesize or produce synthetic NCII and CSAM. Websites, mobile apps, and custom-built models that generate synthetic NCII have moved from niche internet forums to mainstream, automated, and scaled online businesses.

## 2.12. **Value Chain And Component Integration**

GAI value chains involve many third-party components such as procured datasets, pre-trained models, and software libraries. These components might be improperly obtained or not properly vetted, leading to diminished transparency or accountability for downstream users. While this is a risk for traditional AI systems and some other digital technologies, the risk is exacerbated for GAI due to the scale of the training data, which may be too large for humans to vet; the difficulty of training foundation models, which leads to extensive reuse of limited numbers of models; and the extent to which GAI may be integrated into other devices and services. As GAI systems often involve many distinct third-party components and data sources, it may be difficult to attribute issues in a system's behavior to any one of these sources. Errors in third-party GAI components can also have downstream impacts on accuracy and robustness. For example, test datasets commonly used to benchmark or validate models can contain label errors. Inaccuracies in these labels can impact the "stability" or robustness of these benchmarks, which many GAI practitioners consider during the model selection process.

## 3. Suggested Actions **To Manage Gai Risks**

The following suggested actions target risks unique to or exacerbated by GAI. In addition to the suggested actions below, AI risk management activities and actions set forth in the AI RMF 1.0 and Playbook are already applicable for managing GAI risks. Organizations are encouraged to apply the activities suggested in the AI RMF and its Playbook when managing the risk of GAI systems. 

Implementation of the suggested actions will vary depending on the type of risk, characteristics of GAI systems, stage of the GAI lifecycle, and relevant AI actors involved. Suggested actions to manage GAI risks can be found in the tables below: 
- The suggested actions are organized by **relevant AI RMF subcategories** to streamline these activities alongside implementation of the AI RMF. 

- Not **every subcategory of the AI RMF is included in this document.**13 Suggested actions are listed for only some subcategories. 

13 As this document was focused on the GAI PWG efforts and primary considerations (see Appendix A), AI RMF
subcategories not addressed here may be added later. 
- Not every suggested action applies to **every** AI Actor14 or is relevant to every AI Actor Task. For example, suggested actions relevant to GAI developers may not be relevant to GAI deployers. The applicability of suggested actions to relevant AI actors should be determined based on organizational considerations and their unique uses of GAI systems. 

Each table of suggested actions includes:
- **Action ID:** Each Action ID corresponds to the relevant AI RMF function and subcategory (e.g., GV1.1-001 corresponds to the first suggested action for Govern 1.1, GV-1.1-002 corresponds to the second suggested action for Govern 1.1). AI RMF functions are tagged as follows: GV = Govern; MP = Map; MS = Measure; MG = Manage.

- Suggested **Action:** Steps an organization or AI actor can take to manage GAI risks. 

- **GAI Risks:** Tags linking suggested actions with relevant GAI risks. 

- AI Actor **Tasks:** Pertinent AI Actor Tasks for each subcategory. Not every AI Actor Task listed will apply to every suggested action in the subcategory (i.e., some apply to AI development and others apply to AI deployment). 

The tables below begin with the AI RMF subcategory, shaded in blue, followed by suggested actions.

## Appendix A. **Primary Gai Considerations**

The following primary considerations were derived as overarching themes from the GAI PWG consultation process. These considerations (Governance, Pre-Deployment Testing, Content Provenance, and Incident Disclosure) are relevant for voluntary use by any organization designing, developing, and using GAI and also inform the Actions to Manage GAI risks. Information included about the primary considerations is not exhaustive, but highlights the most relevant topics derived from the GAI PWG. Acknowledgments: These considerations could not have been surfaced without the helpful analysis and contributions from the community and NIST staff GAI PWG leads: George Awad, Luca Belli, Harold Booth, Mat Heyman, Yooyoung Lee, Mark Pryzbocki, Reva Schwartz, Martin Stanley, and Kyra Yee.

## A.1. **Governance** A.1.1. **Overview**

Like any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks related to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their existing risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may opt to revise or update AI system risk levels to address these unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be reevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third-party considerations for governing across the AI value chain. 

## A.1.2. Organizational **Governance**

GAI opportunities, risks and long-term performance characteristics are typically less well-understood than non-generative AI tools and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. Accordingly, GAI may call for different levels of oversight from AI Actors or different human-AI configurations in order to manage their risks effectively. Organizations' use of GAI systems may also warrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight. AI technology can produce varied outputs in multiple modalities and present many classes of user interfaces. This leads to a broader set of AI Actors interacting with GAI systems for widely differing applications and contexts of use. These can include data labeling and preparation, development of GAI models, content moderation, code generation and review, text generation and editing, image and video generation, summarization, search, and chat. These activities can take place within organizational settings or in the public domain. Organizations can restrict AI applications that cause harm, exceed stated risk tolerances, or that conflict with their tolerances or values. Governance tools and protocols that are applied to other types of AI systems can be applied to GAI systems. These plans and actions include: 
- Accessibility and reasonable accommodations
- AI actor credentials and qualifications - Alignment to organizational values
- Auditing and assessment - Change-management controls
- Commercial use - Data provenance
- Data protection - Data retention - Consistency in use of defining key terms
- Decommissioning
- Discouraging anonymous use - Education 
- Impact assessments - Incident response - Monitoring - Opt-outs 
- Risk-based controls - Risk mapping and measurement - Science-backed TEVV practices
- Secure software development practices
- Stakeholder engagement - Synthetic content detection and labeling tools and techniques
- Whistleblower protections - Workforce diversity and interdisciplinary teams Establishing acceptable use policies and guidance for the use of GAI in formal human-AI teaming settings as well as different levels of human-AI configurations can help to decrease risks arising from misuse, abuse, inappropriate repurpose, and misalignment between systems and users. These practices are just one example of adapting existing governance protocols for GAI contexts. 

## A.1.3. Third-**Party Considerations**

Organizations may seek to acquire, embed, incorporate, or use open-source or proprietary third-party GAI models, systems, or generated data for various applications across an enterprise. Use of these GAI tools and inputs has implications for all functions of the organization - including but not limited to acquisition, human resources, legal, compliance, and IT services - regardless of whether they are carried out by employees or third parties. Many of the actions cited above are relevant and options for addressing third-party considerations. Third party GAI integrations may give rise to increased intellectual property, data privacy, or information security risks, pointing to the need for clear guidelines for transparency and risk management regarding the collection and use of third-party data for model inputs. Organizations may consider varying risk controls for foundation models, fine-tuned models, and embedded tools, enhanced processes for interacting with external GAI technologies or service providers. Organizations can apply standard or existing risk controls and processes to proprietary or open-source GAI technologies, data, and third-party service providers, including acquisition and procurement due diligence, requests for software bills of materials (SBOMs), application of service level agreements (SLAs), and statement on standards for attestation engagement (SSAE) reports to help with third-party transparency and risk management for GAI systems.

## A.1.4. Pre-**Deployment Testing** Overview

The diverse ways and contexts in which GAI systems may be developed, used, and repurposed complicates risk mapping and pre-deployment measurement efforts. Robust test, evaluation, validation, and verification (TEVV) processes can be iteratively applied - and documented - in early stages of the AI lifecycle and informed by representative AI Actors (see Figure 3 of the AI RMF). Until new and rigorous early lifecycle TEVV approaches are developed and matured for GAI, organizations may use recommended "pre-deployment testing" practices to measure performance, capabilities, limits, risks, and impacts. This section describes risk measurement and estimation as part of pre-deployment TEVV, and examines the state of play for pre-deployment testing methodologies. 

## Limitations Of Current Pre**-Deployment Test Approaches**

Currently available pre-deployment TEVV processes used for GAI applications may be inadequate, nonsystematically applied, or fail to reflect or mismatched to deployment contexts. For example, the anecdotal testing of GAI system capabilities through video games or standardized tests designed for humans (e.g., intelligence tests, professional licensing exams) does not guarantee GAI system validity or reliability in those domains. Similarly, jailbreaking or prompt engineering tests may not systematically assess validity or reliability risks. 

Measurement gaps can arise from mismatches between laboratory and real-world settings. Current testing approaches often remain focused on laboratory conditions or restricted to benchmark test datasets and in silico techniques that may not extrapolate well toâ€”or directly assess GAI impacts in realworld conditions. For example, current measurement gaps for GAI make it difficult to precisely estimate its potential ecosystem-level or longitudinal risks and related political, social, and economic impacts. Gaps between benchmarks and real-world use of GAI systems may likely be exacerbated due to prompt sensitivity and broad heterogeneity of contexts of use.

## A.1.5. **Structured Public Feedback**

Structured public feedback can be used to evaluate whether GAI systems are performing as intended and to calibrate and verify traditional measurement methods. Examples of structured feedback include, but are not limited to:
- **Participatory Engagement Methods**: Methods used to solicit feedback from civil society groups, affected communities, and users, including focus groups, small user studies, and surveys.

- **Field Testing**: Methods used to determine how people interact with, consume, use, and make sense of AI-generated information, and subsequent actions and effects, including UX, usability, and other structured, randomized experiments. 

- **AI Red-teaming:** A structured testing exercise used to probe an AI system to find flaws and vulnerabilities such as inaccurate, harmful, or discriminatory outputs, often in a controlled environment and in collaboration with system developers.

Information gathered from structured public feedback can inform design, implementation, deployment approval, maintenance, or decommissioning decisions. Results and insights gleaned from these exercises can serve multiple purposes, including improving data quality and preprocessing, bolstering governance decision making, and enhancing system documentation and debugging practices. When implementing feedback activities, organizations should follow human subjects research requirements and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation.

## Participatory Engagement Methods

On an ad hoc or more structured basis, organizations can design and use a variety of channels to engage external stakeholders in product development or review. Focus groups with select experts can provide feedback on a range of issues. Small user studies can provide feedback from representative groups or populations. Anonymous surveys can be used to poll or gauge reactions to specific features. Participatory engagement methods are often less structured than field testing or red teaming, and are more commonly used in early stages of AI or product development. 

## Field Testing

Field testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions under which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user preferences and experiences towards AI risks and impacts - both negative and positive. When carried out with large groups of users, these tests can provide estimations of the likelihood of risks and impacts in real world interactions. Organizations may also collect feedback on outcomes, harms, and user experience directly from users in the production environment after a model has been released, in accordance with human subject standards such as informed consent and compensation. Organizations should follow applicable human subjects research requirements, and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation, when implementing feedback activities.

## Ai Red-Teaming

AI red-teaming is an evolving practice that references exercises often conducted in a controlled environment and in collaboration with AI developers building AI models to identify potential adverse behavior or outcomes of a GAI model or system, how they could occur, and stress test safeguards". AI red-teaming can be performed before or after AI models or systems are made available to the broader public; this section focuses on red-teaming in pre-deployment contexts. The quality of AI red-teaming outputs is related to the background and expertise of the AI red team itself. Demographically and interdisciplinarily diverse AI red teams can be used to identify flaws in the varying contexts where GAI will be used. For best results, AI red teams should demonstrate domain expertise, and awareness of socio-cultural aspects within the deployment context. AI red-teaming results should be given additional analysis before they are incorporated into organizational governance and decision making, policy and procedural updates, and AI risk management efforts. Various types of AI red-teaming may be appropriate, depending on the use case:
- General Public: Performed by general users (not necessarily AI or technical experts) who are expected to use the model or interact with its outputs, and who bring their own lived experiences and perspectives to the task of AI red-teaming. These individuals may have been provided instructions and material to complete tasks which may elicit harmful model behaviors. This type of exercise can be more effective with large groups of AI red-teamers.

- Expert: Performed by specialists with expertise in the domain or specific AI red-teaming context of use (e.g., medicine, biotech, cybersecurity). 

- Combination: In scenarios when it is difficult to identify and recruit specialists with sufficient domain and contextual expertise, AI red-teaming exercises may leverage both expert and general public participants. For example, expert AI red-teamers could modify or verify the prompts written by general public AI red-teamers. These approaches may also expand coverage of the AI risk attack surface. 

- Human / AI: Performed by GAI in combination with specialist or non-specialist human teams. 

GAI-led red-teaming can be more cost effective than human red-teamers alone. Human or GAIled AI red-teaming may be better suited for eliciting different types of harms. 

## A.1.6. **Content Provenance** Overview

GAI technologies can be leveraged for many applications such as content generation and synthetic data. 

Some aspects of GAI outputs, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to distinguish human-generated content from AI-generated synthetic content. To help manage and mitigate these risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and history of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater information access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of trustworthiness in AI systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, digital content transparency approaches can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their source, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection mechanisms provide information about the origin and history of content to assist in GAI risk management efforts. Provenance metadata can include information about GAI model developers or creators of GAI content, date/time of creation, location, modifications, and sources. Metadata can be tracked for text, images, videos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can help assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital content. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, metadata recording, digital fingerprinting, and human authentication, among others. 

## Provenance Data Tracking Approaches

Provenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data inputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for digital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata as well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin and history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data tracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or control over the various trade-offs and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream performance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize robustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational complexity (the resources required to implement watermarking). Organizational risk management efforts for enhancing content provenance include: 
- Tracking provenance of training data and metadata for GAI systems;
- Documenting provenance data limitations within GAI systems;
- Monitoring system capabilities and limitations in deployment through rigorous TEVV processes; - Evaluating how humans engage, interact with, or adapt to GAI content (especially in decision making tasks informed by GAI content), and how they react to applied provenance techniques such as overt disclosures.

Organizations can document and delineate GAI system objectives and limitations to identify gaps where provenance data may be most useful. For instance, GAI systems used for content creation may require robust watermarking techniques and corresponding detectors to identify the source of content or metadata recording techniques and metadata management tools and repositories to trace content origins and modifications. Further narrowing of GAI task definitions to include provenance data can enable organizations to maximize the utility of provenance data and risk management efforts.

## A.1.7. **Enhancing Content Provenance Through Structured Public Feedback**

While indirect feedback methods such as automated error collection systems are useful, they often lack the context and depth that direct input from end users can provide. Organizations can leverage feedback approaches described in the Pre-Deployment Testing section to capture input from external sources such as through AI red-teaming. Integrating pre- and post-deployment external feedback into the monitoring process for GAI models and corresponding applications can help enhance awareness of performance changes and mitigate potential risks and harms from outputs. There are many ways to capture and make use of user feedback - before and after GAI systems and digital content transparency approaches are deployed - to gain insights about authentication efficacy and vulnerabilities, impacts of adversarial threats on techniques, and unintended consequences resulting from the utilization of content provenance approaches on users and communities. Furthermore, organizations can track and document the provenance of datasets to identify instances in which AI-generated data is a potential root cause of performance issues with the GAI system.

## A.1.8. **Incident Disclosure** Overview

AI incidents can be defined as an "event, circumstance, or series of events where the development, use, or malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly contributes to one of the following harms: injury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people (including psychological harms and harms to mental health); disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; violations of human rights or a breach of obligations under applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labor, and intellectual property rights; or harm to property, communities, or the environment." AI incidents can occur in the aggregate (i.e., for systemic discrimination) or acutely (i.e., for one individual).

## State Of Ai Incident Tracking And Disclosure

Formal channels do not currently exist to report and document AI incidents. However, a number of publicly available databases have been created to document their occurrence. These reporting channels make decisions on an ad hoc basis about what kinds of incidents to track. Some, for example, track by amount of media coverage. Documenting, reporting, and sharing information about GAI incidents can help mitigate and prevent harmful outcomes by assisting relevant AI Actors in tracing impacts to their source. Greater awareness and standardization of GAI incident reporting could promote this transparency and improve GAI risk management across the AI ecosystem. 

## Documentation And Involvement Of Ai Actors

AI Actors should be aware of their roles in reporting AI incidents. To better understand previous incidents and implement measures to prevent similar ones in the future, organizations could consider developing guidelines for publicly available incident reporting which include information about AI actor responsibilities. These guidelines would help AI system operators identify GAI incidents across the AI lifecycle and with AI Actors regardless of role. Documentation and review of third-party inputs and plugins for GAI systems is especially important for AI Actors in the context of incident disclosure; LLM 
inputs and content delivered through these plugins is often distributed, with inconsistent or insufficient access control. Documentation practices including logging, recording, and analyzing GAI incidents can facilitate smoother sharing of information with relevant AI Actors. Regular information sharing, change management records, version history and metadata can also empower AI Actors responding to and managing AI incidents.
