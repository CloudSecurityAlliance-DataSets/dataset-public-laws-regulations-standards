It is shared and should be implemented by each party, CSC and the CSP, however independently from one another. Both entities may have different screening policies and processes that they should fill respective of their countries, contractual and regulatory requirements.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n The CSP is responsible for implementing internal measures to ensure that permanent and temporary staff, outsourced consultants and any other third-party service providers have been appropriately screened and vetted in relation to the level, amount and frequency of access to systems or sites required by their role. The screening processes should be established and precede any activity in granting access to systems. \n \n Screening processes should be conducted by authorized and specialized departments to compartmentalize any and all personal data/sensitive information gathered during the screening processes. The CSP should make reasonable arrangements to assure the CSC of staff trust level. Where appropriate, it should conduct client-specific screening to their requirements for staff with access to the CSC's systems such as government or law enforcement agencies. In situations where screening is delayed, for example, the inability to contact references or verification checks taking a long time, should implement mitigating controls for the interim, such as:\n a. Delaying start date or onboarding\n b. Not issuing access or credentials\n c. Allowing access but limiting or restricting permissions\n \n Where circumstances cause complications, or screening has detected previous issues such as criminal records or information that causes concern, processes should be in place to escalate matters or to terminate offers of employment.\n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\n a. Scope and Objectives: the scope and objectives of background verification, including the types of positions, roles, and access levels of employees, contractors, and third parties that require background checks. The verification process should be tailored to the level of access to sensitive data and the nature of responsibilities\n b. Compliance with Local Laws and Regulations: Ensure compliance with local, regional, and international laws and regulations regarding background checks and data privacy\n i. obtain necessary consents, ensuring data privacy, and complying with record retention requirements.\n ii. Consider specific regulations related to the handling of personal information in different jurisdictions\n c. Ethics and Contractual Constraints: ethical considerations and contractual obligations with customers and partners. It should ensure that background checks are conducted in a fair and unbiased manner, minimizing any potential for discrimination or invasion of privacy\n d. Risk Assessment for Background Verification: The extent of background verification should be proportionate to the data classification to be accessed, the business requirements, and the acceptable risk level. More sensitive roles or access to highly confidential data may warrant more rigorous background checks.\n e. Verification Checks: Outline the specific verification checks to be conducted.\n i. Identity Verification: Confirming the individual's identity through valid government-issued documents.\n ii. Education Verification: Verifying educational credentials and qualifications as claimed (e.g., claimed degrees and certifications)\n iii. Employment History Verification: Verifying previous employment history and job responsibilities (e.g., positions held, duration, and reasons for leaving.\n iv. Reference Checks: Conduct professional reference checks to assess the candidate's skills, work habits, and reliability.\n v. Criminal Background Checks: Conduct criminal background checks in accordance with local laws and regulations and define the criteria for disqualification based on the nature of offenses\n f. Third-Party Background Check Services: If using third-party background check providers, the policy should establish strict guidelines for selecting reputable and secure service providers\n i. Include background verification requirements in contracts with third-party vendors and contractors\n ii. Specify the level of scrutiny based on the services provided and access granted\n iii. Require contractors and third parties to undergo security awareness training to align with the organization's security policies\n g. Disclosure and Authorization: outline the process for obtaining necessary consents and authorizations from individuals for conducting background checks. It should also clarify the purpose of the checks and how the information will be used and protected.\n h. Record Retention: specify requirements for the duration for retaining background check records, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and contractual obligations (also regarding storage and disposal of personal information). Maintain audit trails of the background verification process for accountability and compliance purposes\n i. Incident Response: An incident response protocol in case any adverse or unexpected findings are revealed during the background verification process\n j. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite\n i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures\n ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained\n k. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders\n l. Maintenance and Reviews: Policies and procedures for background verification checks should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks",

Remote working increases the risk and threat profile of a cloud organization as these boundaries of protection may become weakened or assets may be compromised through various means. The CSP has a responsibility to protect its core systems and its CSC's data. The policy should be defined and deployed to provide its personnel the appropriate security requirements, controls and procedures to follow while they work remotely.\n \n Personnel should be trained and informed of risks when working remotely, as the shift to a decentralized work environment introduces various cybersecurity threats that individuals must be vigilant against. \n \n One prevalent risk is the increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. Additionally, the use of unsecured Wi-Fi networks in home environments poses a potential threat, as it opens avenues for unauthorized access and data interception. Remote workers should also be cautious about the security of their devices, as the loss or theft of laptops or mobile devices can lead to unauthorized access to corporate data. Furthermore, the reliance on personal devices and unsecured applications for work tasks may expose organizations to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information. \n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\n a. Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access, process, or store information accessed, processed or stored at remote sites and locations in the context of cloud computing and cloud security. Objective of policy is to ensure that remote employees are aware of and comply with the organization's cloud security policies and procedures\n b. Secure Network Connections: Require the use of a VPN for secure and encrypted communication, with strong encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms, between remote devices and the corporate network\n c. Remote Working MFA Access: Require the use of MFA for accessing corporate systems and cloud services. The use of MFA on all devices and applications to add an extra layer of security should be encouraged\n d. Endpoints Protection: Require the deployment of endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware and other security threats\n i. Implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Endpoint Management solutions for remote device configuration, monitoring, and security enforcement (e.g., anti-malware, device encryption, secure email, etc.) (refer to UEM domain)\n ii. Educate remote workers about the risks of using public Wi-Fi and recommend the use of a VPN when connecting to public networks\n iii. Provide guidelines for securing home Wi-Fi networks, including the use of strong encryption (WPA3) and changing default credentials\n e. Secure Remote Desktop Solutions: Where applicable, require the use secure remote desktop solutions with strong encryption and authentication\n f.
