The CSP’s attestation should also consider subservice organizations that it relies upon to provide key services, e.g., infrastructure hosting.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n The CSP should establish formal policies and procedures based on industry best practices and relevant standards to educate its personnel of the required baseline for information security standards and guidelines. It should establish and document an approved and organized approach to its regulatory and contractual requirements, or security requirements in standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, AICPA TSC (SOC 2), and CSA CCM in order to prepare and plan its audit and assurance activities.\n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\n a. Scope and Objectives: \n i. The scope of audit and assurance activities should be defined, including the cloud services, environments, and data to be audited\n ii. A risk-based audit plan should be developed that prioritizes areas of highest risk and aligns with the defined business objectives\n iii. Authority and accountability for audit completion should be defined, and requirements to comply and/or assist with audits\n b. Independent Assessments: Requirements to conduct independent assessments by qualified and independent third-party auditors to evaluate compliance with relevant standards, security policies, legal and contractual requirements\n i. Auditors should have least privilege access to only relevant and necessary information and resources allowing to conduct the audit\n ii. A conflict of interest policy should be in place to maintain auditors objectivity and independence\n c. Risk-Based Planning Assessment: Requirements on evaluating the effectiveness of the CSP's risk-based plans and internal policies in identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks and potential security vulnerabilities within the cloud environment\n d. Requirements Compliance: Requirements for the CSP to verify compliance for its cloud security practices with all applicable standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements, including data privacy laws, industry-specific regulations, and customer contractual obligations that are applicable to the audit\n e. Audit Management Process: An audit management process to govern audit planning, execution, and reporting on cloud security audits. This includes defining the scope, frequency, and methodologies for audits, as well as the roles and responsibilities of audit personnel\n f. Remediation: A risk-based corrective action plan to address audit findings in a timely and effective manner. The plan should:\n i. Structure audit finding reviews, and track any findings\n ii. Prioritize findings based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurring, \n iii. Assign clear ownership and timelines for remediation and track progress towards resolving identified issues\n Additionally, the CSP should regularly review and report remediation status to relevant stakeholders\n g. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite\n i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures\n ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions should be maintained\n h. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders. Communication channels should be established with relevant stakeholders that require record of activities and provide them with reports of audit findings, audit-related issues and remediation strategies\n i. Maintenance and Reviews: Audit and assurance policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks",
