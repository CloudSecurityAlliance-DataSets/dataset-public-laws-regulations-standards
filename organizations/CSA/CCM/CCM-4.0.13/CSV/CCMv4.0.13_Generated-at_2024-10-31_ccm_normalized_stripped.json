Integration of security best practices throughout the entire development lifecycle, can help CSPs to effectively protect their applications from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks.\n\nDefining security requirements should be the first step in the SSDLC process to ensure that security is integrated throughout all phases of development. Security requirements should derive from security objectives and/or organizational goals and regulatory requirements. Industry standards should be applied at project inception and every stage of the SSDLC process.

SSDLC Governance: A security governance framework should be implemented that is tailored to the SSDLC and that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability for security throughout the SSDLC\ni. The CSP's SSDLC processes, at a minimum, should meet the regulatory and CSC's business requirements\nii. The CSP should provide information to CSCs about the SSDLC to the extent compatible with their disclosure policies\nb. DevSecOps: A DevSecOps approach should be defined and implemented that integrates security practices into all stages of the SSDLC, from planning and design to development, testing, deployment, and operation, rather than being an afterthought\nc. Threat Modeling: Threat modeling should be incorporated into the early stages of the SSDLC to identify potential security risks and design mitigation strategies to help developers anticipate and proactively address security issues, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced later in the development cycle\nd. Secure Coding Practices: \ni. Comprehensive security design requirements should be defined that specify the security measures and controls to be implemented throughout the application's architecture\nii. Industry standard (OWASP, etc) secure coding guidelines should be incorporated in the SSDLC\niii. Secure coding guidelines should be followed and implemented respectively (e.g., proper implementation and configuration of security headers, input validation, information output handling, error handling, and proper use of cryptographic libraries)\ne. Open Source Components Secure Use: Secure practices for managing open-source components should be employed, including thorough vulnerability scanning, dependency management, and continuous monitoring for known vulnerabilities. Use trusted open-source repositories and ensure proper attribution and licensing compliance\nf. Vulnerability Management: Continuously scan for and remediate vulnerabilities in code, infrastructure, and third-party components (refer to TVM domain)\ng. Security Testing: Regular security audits, static, dynamic application security testing, and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential security weaknesses (refer to AIS-05 and TVM-06)\nh. Secure Deployment and Configuration Management:\ni. Secure deployment and configuration management practices should be implemented to ensure that cloud-based applications are deployed and configured in a secure manner\nii. Automated tools should be used to enforce consistent configurations and monitor for deviations from security policies\ni. EoL Process: When an application reaches its end-of-life, a CSP should at minimum:\ni. Notify CSCs of the EoL date and provide clear instructions on how to migrate to alternative services\nii. Discontinue providing technical support and updates for the application and archive the application's source code and documentation\niii. Ensure that all application associated data is properly deleted or transferred to the CSC's designated location\niv. Review and assess potential security vulnerabilities during the decommissioning process\n\nThe CSPs should be transparent about their security practices and provide CSCs with the necessary tools and support to meet their security requirements.

SSDLC and Testing Management: The development team should follow the SSDLC with security best practices to create code that is secure by design, as well as use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify security loopholes present in the code\nb. Continuous CI/CD Testing: Continuous testing should be built into CI/CD pipelines: \ni. Understand that CI/CD is just not delivering the code, rather also an opportunity to adopt a \"shift-left\" approach with continuous testing\nii. Pre-commit and post-commit hooks should be implemented and used\niii. A vulnerability scanner should be used to identify any third-party library issues\niv. An automated scanner should be used to identify hardcoded / default secrets, including access keys, secret key, credentials, private keys, etc.\nc. Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST should be used to analyze the application's source code, bytecode, or binary code to detect issues early in the development lifecycle and identify security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers (e.g., data/control flow, taint analysis)\nd. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): DAST should be used to test the application in its running state to identify security vulnerabilities by sending requests and analyzing the responses (e.g., fuzz testing, session hijacking, injection testing)\ne. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST): IAST should be used to combine elements of both SAST and DAST, identify security issues without the need for source code access, and provide real-time feedback on security vulnerabilities during the application's runtime\nf. Penetration Testing: Penetration tests should be performed to simulate real-world cyberattacks to identify potential vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of the security measures in place\ng. Input Validation: Input validation test cases should be used to identify injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Command Injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This includes checking the type, format, length, and range of input data to ensure that it adheres to predefined criteria and does not contain any malicious or unauthorized content\nh. Information Output Handling: Information output filtering test cases should be used to identify information exfiltration attacks (e.g., cleartext output of passwords)\ni. Industry Best Practices: Security test cases should be employed according to OWASP Top 10. Consider also aligning test cases with various compliance standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, AICPA TSC) depending on organizational strategy and requirements\nj. Continuous Monitoring: Continuous monitoring should be required once an application is deployed to test for a crash, DoS, DDoS, unauthenticated scans, etc.\nk. Applications Testing Automation: \ni. The test team should leverage automation to expedite the testing completion process and for efficacy in reducing errors and surfacing security gaps\nii. Automated tools should test applications for both known and unknown vulnerabilities\niii.

In the SaaS model, the CSC responsibility arises from the fact that SaaS CSPs typically offer ready-to-use applications and services, while the CSC remains accountable for configuring and customizing these services to meet their specific needs and requirements. Consequently, the CSC should ensure that the criteria for upgrades, modifications, or acceptance of new systems and versions align with their organizational security standards, compliance requirements, and application-specific needs. By implementing a rigorous testing strategy, the SaaS CSC can verify the compatibility, appropriate security, and proper functionality of the upgrades or new systems before their integration into the organization's workflow.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nFor the IaaS and PaaS CSC, as part of a comprehensive testing strategy, the same guidelines as for the CSP apply, and additionally ensure the proper configuration, upgrades, and secure integration of new systems and new versions of systems and applications. \n\nIn particular with respect to the SaaS CSC, the following implementation guidelines apply:\na. Configuration of Applications: The SaaS customer should configure the application settings and permissions according to their specific business requirements, ensuring that access controls, user privileges, and data encryption are appropriately set up to mitigate security risks and maintain data privacy\nb. Application Upgrades: Prior to implementing any application upgrades, the SaaS customer should conduct thorough testing, including functional, compatibility, and security testing, to ensure that the upgrades do not disrupt the existing workflows or compromise the application's security posture. This also involves maintaining a rollback plan in case any issues arise during the upgrade process\nc. Secure Integration of New Systems: The SaaS customer should evaluate the compatibility of the new systems with the existing infrastructure and conduct comprehensive integration testing to ensure that data integrity, security protocols, and application functionalities are maintained throughout the integration process. Secure authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and access controls should be implemented to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities during the integration of new version systems\n\nAutomation of security testing should be implemented to reduce risks and errors and enable the scaling of security practices to meet organizational demands.

The severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities should be assessed based on factors such as exploitability, target scope, and potential consequences\nii. Vulnerability assessment tools should be utilized to provide risk scores\niii. Vulnerabilities remediation should be prioritized based on their risk scores, considering factors such as business criticality, asset value, regulatory compliance requirements, and industry standard vulnerability scoring systems such as CVSS if applicable\niv. Threat intelligence feeds should be incorporated into the prioritization process to identify vulnerabilities actively exploited by attackers\nd. Track and Measure Progress: Progress on remediation efforts should be tracked and the effectiveness of the vulnerability remediation process measured\ne. Patch Management Automation: Application of patches should be automated to reduce the time and effort required to remediate vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of cloud-based applications (refer to TVM domain)\nf. Remediation Automation:\ni. Configuration management tools should be utilized to automatically correct misconfigured security settings and enforce secure configurations across different environments using secure by default principles\nii. Automated code refactoring tools should be employed to address insecure coding practices and enforce secure coding guidelines within applications\niii. Automated dependency management tools should be utilized to update and replace vulnerable open-source components with patched or updated versions\niv. Automated remediation hooks should be implemented within the CI/CD pipeline to automatically remediate identified vulnerabilities before and after deployment\ng. Remediation Logging: Comprehensive logging of remediation activities should be established to track the remediation process and identify potential issues\nh. Post-Remediation Verification: Post-remediation verification steps should be implemented to ensure that vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed and that no new vulnerabilities have been introduced\ni. Continuous Remediation Monitoring: The effectiveness of the vulnerability remediation process should be continuously monitored and improvements made as needed\nj. Notification and Reporting: Notification and reporting mechanisms should be established to inform relevant stakeholders of any vulnerabilities detected and remediation actions taken\ni. Communicate with CSCs any identified vulnerabilities and the plan to remediate them. Communication should be timely and transparent in accordance with agreed SLAs\n\nVulnerabilities should be identified and remediated as early as possible in the SSDLC and automated processes are ideal for such a task.\n\nVulnerability Scanning and Remediation Examples:\nTo ensure that only secure and hardened container images are used in the application development process, integrate a vulnerability scanner into the CI/CD pipeline specifically for \"image\" scanning. This will guarantee that only secure \"images\" (also known as golden images) are incorporated into the application software builds.\n\nAutomated scanning tools are an effective solution for identifying and remediating such issues. For instance, cloud agent-based tools can be deployed on each active VM instance to continuously scan for third-party security vulnerabilities, with the frequency of scans determined by the organization's security strategy (daily, weekly, etc.).\n",
        "Implementation Guidelines_CSC": "Control Ownership Rationale.\nWidespread vulnerabilities may require action by both the CSP and CSC, however the CSC is responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in their cloud environment.  \n\nIn the SaaS model, the CSC is responsible for identifying vulnerabilities related to any application-level misconfigurations (e.g., API configuration settings, access control settings) that are within the control of the CSC. Therefore, while the SaaS customer is not responsible for identifying infrastructure and insecure code related vulnerabilities on the SaaS application it consumes, it may have to coordinate with the CSP to identify, understand, and manage any vulnerabilities related to the application stack the CSC owns and controls, including the applications vulnerabilities remediation and response scheduling.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nThe implementation guidelines as provided for the CSP apply to IaaS, PaaS CSC.\n\nIn addition, as it pertains to the SaaS CSC, misconfigurations can be considered a vulnerability, as they can inadvertently expose the application to security risks and potential breaches.\nSaaS CSC implementation guidelines for application security vulnerabilities remediation include:\na. Configuration Management: Ensuring that the application's configuration settings are appropriately set up to align with the organization's security requirements and best practices. This involves properly configuring access controls, user permissions, and encryption settings (including the use of strong encryption protocols and properly managed encryption keys)\nb. Default Security Configurations: Customize and strengthen default security configurations to align with organizational security policies. To remediate such vulnerabilities: \ni. Regularly review and update default security settings to address emerging security threats\nii. Conduct regular security assessments to identify any weaknesses in default security settings\nc. Access Control Management: Implementing robust access controls and authentication mechanisms to regulate user access and privileges within the SaaS application. This includes managing user roles, permissions, and identity verification to prevent unauthorized access and unauthorized activities within the application\nd. Unmanaged Shadow IT and Unsanctioned Applications: Usage of unsanctioned or unmanaged applications by employees within the SaaS CSC organization can introduce security risks and vulnerabilities that may not be adequately addressed or monitored by the SaaS CSP. To remediate such vulnerabilities:\ni. Implement strict policies to prevent the use of unsanctioned applications and shadow IT\nii. Provide clear guidelines and recommendations to personnel for approved applications and IT resources\niii.

Change Risk Management: The impact and type of change should be assessed to determine the risk of the change before it is applies\ni. Before implementing a change, CSPs should conduct a thorough impact assessment to identify potential consequences on cloud assets, performance, security, and compliance requirements\nii. Changes are categorized based on their impact, urgency, and risk profile. High-risk changes receive prioritized attention and undergo rigorous review and testing\niii. Evolving risks associated with cloud assets and change management practices should be regularly identified and risk management strategies reviewed and updated accordingly\nc. Change Management Tools: \ni. A change management workflow should be defined to ensure that changes are submitted, reviewed, and approved by relevant stakeholders, including security, operations, and development teams to prevent unauthorized or poorly managed changes\nii. Change management tools should be adopted to effectively record the change management workflow process\nd. Stakeholders Collaboration: \ni. Collaborate with relevant internal and external interested parties involved in the change and risk management processes\nii.

        "Implementation Guidelines_CSC": "Control Ownership Rationale.\nThe control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nThe CSC should reach out to its CSP to understand what tools it provides (e.g., access to the cloud management plane via catalog managers and APIs) that enable the CSC to retrieve the list of cloud assets that are used to handle the CSC's data.\n\nThe CSC should define a tagging strategy for their environment that involves creating a list of tags to categorize assets and asset owners in a catalog. A standardized naming convention is the starting point for organizing the cloud-hosted resources. The same naming conventions on tags should be consistently used across multiple CSPs (e.g., multi-cloud environment), and where possible, cloud assets should be tracked by an automated means, allowing for prompt decisions to be made according to them (e.g., access control decisions, monitoring and alerting, accounting).\n\nTemplates for defining a naming and tagging convention for tagging assets are defined by all major CSPs. The CSC may choose to adopt the CSP's naming standards or define their own that they wish to apply to each asset type they plan to deploy as part of their cloud adoption effort.\n\nExamples of tagging conventions and respective cloud assets types that should be cataloged and tracked are below, where applicable by cloud service model (but not limited to):\na. Asset Tags Types:\ni. Environment Tag: Identifying resources belonging to different environments such as production, development, or testing\nii. Function/Application Tag: Associating resources with specific applications or services within the cloud environment\niii. Department Tag: Associating resources with specific departments in the organization\niv. Location Tag: Tagging resources based on their geographic location or data center region\nv. Owner Tag: Specifying the individual or team responsible for a particular resource\nvi. Release Version Tag: Version number of the software or application they are associated with\nvii. Security Classification Tag:  Identifying the security classification or sensitivity level of resources\nviii. Compliance/Regulatory Tag: Indicate compliance with specific regulations or standards\nix. Automation Tag: Indicate whether the asset should be selected for action by scripts, scanners or other form of automation\nx. Active Tag: Designates resources currently in use for production, development, or other relevant purposes\nxi. Deprecated Tag: Designates resources scheduled for retirement or no longer actively used\nb. Cloud Asset Types:\ni. Virtual machines (e.g., VM instances/images, OS name/version),\nii. Virtual networking (e.g., VPC networks and subnets, DNS records, IP addresses),\niii. Databases (e.g., database/SQL servers),\niv. Storage (e.g., block, file, object storage types), \nv. Applications (e.g., custom applications, container images, software licenses)\n\nThe catalog should include all device status changes (e.g., patch levels, lost/decommissioned status, and to whom the asset type is assigned, or approved for BYOD).\n\nCloud asset cataloging and tracking should be prioritized to include the most security-relevant or critical ones followed by the inclusion of remaining asset types that pertain to minimal or no risk.\n\nIf supported by the CSP, automated scans should be made to identify assets that are not tagged or have tagged values not aligned to CSC's tagging rules (e.g., assets tagged or not tagged with a 'classification level' value).\n\nWhen tagging tools are not made available from the CSP, the CSC should proceed with manually tagging and cataloging assets. Easy-to-parse formats (JSON, YAML, XML) should be preferred for more efficient management and maintenance of the catalog.\n\nThe CSC should map security tools to the assets included in the catalog in order to prevent, detect, recover, and respond to security risks that are applicable to them (e.g., use vulnerabilities patching and antivirus tools with VM/OS assets as preventive and detective security controls).\n\nAssets that have been tagged with a 'Security Classification Level' key type should inherit the highest data classification level (high-water mark) value among the different classification levels of data that the particular asset type is destined to use for performing computational, network or storage operations on such data.\n",

These risks can cause significant downtime, data loss, and financial damage to businesses.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, CSPs should implement a comprehensive strategy that includes (but is not limited) the following best practices:\na. Environmental Risk Assessment:\ni. A risk assessment should be conducted to identify potential natural environment risks in different geographical locations (e.g., fires and flooding (waterlogging, water pipe exposure), dust, wind (exposure to open doors/windows), atmospheric electrical discharge, solar induced geomagnetic storm, and natural disasters (earthquake, tsunami, volcanic activity, mudslide, tectonic activity))\nii. Man-made risks and factors should be considered, such as industrial activities, geopolitical stability, and proximity to critical infrastructure (e.g., deliberate attacks include fire, flood, nuclear accident, biological hazard, civil unrest)\nb. Site Selection Distance from High-Risk Areas:\ni. Datacenter locations should be selected in regions with a lower probability of natural disasters (coastal zones susceptible to storm surges or flood-prone regions)\nii. Areas prone to man-made risks, including those with a history of industrial accidents, political instability, or civil unrest should be avoided\niii. A safe distance from critical infrastructure like power plants, chemical facilities, and transportation hubs should also be maintained\nc. Geographic Diversity:\ni. Data centers should be established in geographically diverse locations to mitigate the impact of region-specific risks\nii. No two data centers should be placed in close proximity to minimize the likelihood of simultaneous disruptions\nd. Zoning and Land Use Planning:\ni. Collaboration with local authorities should be established for adherence to zoning regulations and land use planning to avoid areas with known environmental or safety risks\nii. Future developments and urban expansion should be considered when selecting a site\ne. Topography: Locations with favorable topography should be assessed and  selected (e.g., elevated ground to reduce the risk of flooding or water-related disasters, local terrain factors like drainage and susceptibility to seismic activity)\nf. Regulatory Compliance: Compliance with local and international regulations governing the construction and operation of data centers should be established and maintained\ng. Emergency Preparedness and Response: Emergency preparedness and response plans tailored to the specific risks of each location should be developed and regularly updated\nh. Insurance Coverage: Insurance coverage for potential risks associated with the chosen locations, including environmental disasters and business interruption should be obtained\ni. Supplier and Vendor Evaluation: The resilience of critical suppliers and vendors, such as power providers and network carriers should be evaluated to ensure they are also located in low-risk areas\nj.

Cloud organizations, whether operating in a cloud service consumption or cloud service provider role, need to appropriately manage risk, and to establish a formal, documented, leadership-sponsored Enterprise Risk Management program.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nApplicable to all service models:\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) is the overall management of risk for an organization. The service agreement or contract defines important elements such as the scope of services, service levels, responsibilities and obligations, among others, between a CSP and a CSC. While the contract may or may not define roles and responsibilities in detail, and may not address responsibilities for risk management, an entity can never fully outsource its ultimate responsibility and accountability for risk management to an external provider. The purpose of risk management is the creation and protection of value. The risk management process involves the systematic application of policies, procedures, and practices to the activities of communicating and consulting, establishing the context and assessing, treating, monitoring, reviewing, recording, and reporting risk. Risk for the CSP should be calculated using a risk appetite framework that defines the risk capacity or the maximum amount of residual risk it will accept after controls and other measures have been put in place.\n\nThe risk management process should be an integral part of management and decision-making and integrated into the structure, operations and processes of the organization. It can be applied at strategic, operational, program, or project levels. There can be many applications of the risk management process within an organization, customized to achieve objectives and to suit the external and internal context in which they are applied. As part of the ERP program, the Information security risk management process should exist. \n\nThe Information security risk management should also include cloud-relevant information security and data privacy risks when applicable to the organization. \n\nThe CSP and CSP should both have information security risk management processes in place. They are advised to align to the STAR Program and other widely known cyber/cloud security frameworks and standards\n\nIf the CSP uses the services of other providers,, it should ensure information security levels to the CSC are maintained or exceeded.

The CSP is not responsible for maintaining knowledge of, or carrying out forensics investigations on behalf of the CSC. Nevertheless, the CSP should collaborate with the CSC during the forensic-based investigations, specifically in cases where incidents could have originated from the CSP and third-party vendors in the supply chain.\n\nThe policies and procedures should include the phases of the IR life cycle and indicate when the CSP should engage the CSC for security incidents that affect the CSC, as well as the frequency at which the CSP is expected to provide updates during incidents.\n\nThe CSP should communicate the Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, and Cloud Forensics Policies within the organization and may publish or share the IR policy for the CSC's awareness.\n\nPolicies should require establishing a core, qualified, and standing IR team that has the capability to assess, respond, learn, and communicate appropriately.\n\nPolicies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\na. Incident Handling Process: Time-stamped recording of activities in the IR process is necessary for metrics, SLA's, service recovery, and availability\nb. Detection:\ni. the location of the activity resulting in an incident: SaaS (e.g., api, GUI, user, data), PaaS (e.g., api, GUI, user, application, data), IaaS (e.g., api, GUI, user, application, solution stack, VM, data), or at the hypervisor, OS, compute and storage, network, or facility, and the event source logs, including which party (either the CSP or CSC) is responsible for the activity (success and/or failure) logs, as well as the availability of the logs that will be used for detection and other security incident management phases\nii. implementation of advanced detection tools (behavioral and rule-based) with automated alerting should be used by both the CSP and CSC to provide early detection and indication of potential incidents, as well as mechanisms for end user and third-party detection of incidents to be self-reported via ticket, email, telephoning help desk, or other available channels\nc.

The CSC can obtain CSP support via the CSP's Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT)\nd. Containment: \ni. the most common containment techniques (e.g., network, filtering, routing, firewall and port rule changes to deny traffic, traffic filtering or isolation) are usually the responsibility of the CSP and can be automated with capable SIEM/SOAR, logic apps, and workbooks, unless it is a CSP-provided security group firewall which would be the CSC's responsibility\nii. the CSP should contain the security incident by reducing or removing the attacker's ability to continue to exploit the functionality. \niii. the CSP should ensure that forensic evidence is not compromised and that a read-only backup or creating a snapshot should be taken (e.g., cloud block-storage snapshot)\niv. The CSP should follow guidelines on managing the chain of custody for forensic evidence collected from affected systems, devices, cloud services, applications, and personnel. These policies, procedures, and supporting systems should result in legally admissible evidence\ne. Eradication: \ni. the responsibility for addressing the root cause and returning the environment to a safe state needs to be defined between the CSP and CSC, or indicate where it is shared (e.g., removing malware could be the responsibility of both the CSP and the CSC)\nii. the responsibility for closing exposures, removing or resetting credentials, performing key rotation/revocation, stopping an instance, moving to a secure resource, restricting privilege access, ensuring least privilege, need to know and need to use principles should be updated accordingly\nf. Recovery:\ni. restoring from backups, depending on the backup strategy if within the same CSP or another CSP, should be indicated in the policy and follow BCP or DR plans to maintain prioritized sequential restoration and recovery of resources\nii. Both the CSP and CSC will need to meet the changing needs of the scalable environment with adaptable RTO/RPO capabilities when resources delivering the services have expanded dynamically as with auto scaling groups, increased storage, and increased data consumption. \niii. responsibilities for rebuilding systems and allocation of resources to achieve recovery, and for ensuring the security of the recovered environment will need to be defined between the CSP and CSC\ng. Post-Mortem: Recommend configuration changes to the environment to prevent or mitigate future incidents where the CSP and CSC agree, include lessons learned, and KPIs defined and implemented for IR processes and training\nh. Response Time Agreement: \ni. Agree on severity and response time for security incidents between the CSP and CSC where shared responsibility is agreed\nii. Organization-approved industry standards should be consulted\ni. Communication Path with CSC: define the following prior to security incidents in the policies and procedures:\nj. Reporting path: which security incident types should be reported to the CSC\nk. Escalation path:  the escalation path with the CSC prior to a security incident\nl. Notification path: automate where possible, via a security incident management tool, or an alerting service via email. An out-of-band notification path may need to be defined. The IR policy and procedures should include notification requirements and timelines as per regulatory and legal requirements, especially \"Breach Notification\" requirements. Reference the Federal Incident Notification Guidelines where applicable\nm. IR Plan Testing: Test the IR plan periodically, either through paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation with the participation of both the CSP and CSC as well as other relevant parties\nn.

The CSC and CSP jointly engage in implementing, managing, and monitoring the cloud services. The various controls (e.g., from the CCM) should be performed by one party or the other, by both parties independently, or by both parties in a dependent manner. \n\nThe SSRM serves as the key mechanism to:\na. comprehensively elaborate the controls necessary to implement, use, manage, and monitor the cloud services in a secure manner\nb. establish and document a common agreement between the CSP and CSC about their respective responsibilities and expectations regarding the controls\nc. serve as the basis for contractual service agreement and ongoing contractual management and compliance \nd. support effective ongoing control execution, management, monitoring, and assessment activities\ne. facilitate rapid and effective IR and management through clear delineation of responsibilities and communication protocols\nf. foster transparency regarding responsibilities and relationship expectations\n\nOther parties engaged by the CSP or CSC may also be involved in supporting the delivery of cloud services. For example, a SaaS service provided by one CSP may involve the use of another CSP to provide underlying IaaS services. The security responsibilities of any supporting service providers in the supply chain should also be reflected in the SSRM.\n\nGiven the SSRM's critical role in supporting effective cloud security practices, the CSC and CSP should establish and maintain policies and procedures for the application of the SSRM across their respective cloud services. This ensures consistency and adequate coverage across all services. \n\nThe specific SSRM policies and procedures needed for the CSP or CSC may be influenced by a number of factors. They should align with and augment broader organizational policies and procedures for procurement and contract management, third-party risk management, and cybersecurity risk management to adequately address the unique considerations and risks of cloud services. \n\nFurther, the rigor and comprehensiveness of an organization's SSRM policies and procedures should be commensurate with the risks, complexity, and criticality of the cloud services it uses or provides. For example, the SSRM policies and procedures of a CSC that uses a few non-critical SaaS services do not need to be as extensive and rigorous as a CSC whose business fundamentally relies on extensive IaaS. Additionally, the CSC's expectations for security program management will drive the scope and rigor of the SSRM policies and procedures.\n\nThe CSP's policies and procedures should recognize and take into consideration the many CSP- and CSC-specific circumstances that may arise in their cloud service implementations. In particular, exceptions to policies and procedures should be formally managed and approved at the appropriate level of management. This guidance is particularly relevant to contractual commitments between the parties that engender potentially more risk to the CSP or CSC (e.g., compromises a small organization may need to make due to lack of negotiating leverage). \n\nThe SSRM policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with the evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks. Updates should consider and incorporate lessons learned from the CSP's own cloud service implementations, as well as current industry standards and guidance (e.g., current CCM versions and implementation guidelines).  Additionally, if a significantly large, complex, and/or business-critical cloud services implementation is contemplated, the CSP may first want to review existing SSRM policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the anticipated risks and complexity.\n\nThe need to implement and maintain SSRM policies and procedures is the same for all cloud service models, however there may be differences in the specific procedures needed for different cloud service models or for specialized cloud services obtained (e.g., IDaaS).

General Contract Matters: \ni. The contract for the cloud service offering is the legally binding agreement between the CSC and CSP. It is important that the contract agreement and SSRM are consistent. An expectation established in the SSRM in the sales or due diligence phases leading up to contract may have no force or effect if not captured in the contract. In some cases the SSRM may be included as an exhibit or attachment to the contract. The CSP and CSC should both cross check that all CCM control responsibilities in the SSRM are covered and accurately reflected in the proposed contract.\nii. The contract should cover matters beyond just SSRM and security considerations, such as payment terms, limitations of liability, intellectual property rights, etc. The CSP will generally provide the initial proposed contract document, along with any exhibits and referenced provisions (e.g., service offering descriptions maintained online). The CSC may also have template provisions drafted that address its specific requirements or regulatory expectations. Attorneys (either inside counsel or outside counsel) will likely be involved in the negotiating process and review of the final document before signature. It is advisable to engage legal counsel that has prior experience with cloud service agreements and information security matters.\nb. Common SSRM and Security Provisions: Depending on the cloud service model, nature and scope of the specific services involved, and the distribution of security responsibilities, the contract may address many of the CCM control domains. For example, data backup frequency, storage location, and immutability may be addressed for SaaS services or if included in the service offering for IaaS services. Backups may otherwise be the responsibility of the CSC and not specifically addressed in the contract.  \n\nA non-exhaustive list of security provisions that should be addressed in a contract for cloud services include:\na. requirements for HR security practices, to include training and awareness, background checks, termination procedures, insider threat management, etc.\nb. SLAs for availability and support response for issues of various types, to include penalties for failure to meet SLAs\nc. non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions appropriate to the types and manner of information being shared\nd. data protection and data privacy considerations, to include limitations on data storage locations (e.g., cross-border data transfer), environment segregation, CSC segregation, data access, data use, and data disposal\ne. requirements for compliance with laws, regulations, standards, or other contracts (e.g., license or subcontract agreements)\nf. implementation and maintenance of technical controls, such as logging and monitoring, network service protections, etc.\ng. where applicable, requirements for Confidential Computing and workload isolation\nh. joint maintenance and monitoring responsibilities for network connections, APIs, data transfer, and access control interfaces\ni. responsibilities, communications, and restrictions related to change management\nj. clauses for threat and vulnerability management and threat intelligence information exchange\nk. requirements for security incident reporting, to include thresholds, minimum timeframes, and escalation paths, as well as expectations for coordination and information sharing in IR\nl. maintenance of BC and DR plans by the CSP, periodic recovery plan testing, and any expectations for joint or bilateral testing with the CSC\nm. requirements for physical and environmental security, to include the availability of redundant services\nn. requirements for the conduct of independent assessments of the CSP's services, rights for CSC audit, and requirements for demonstrating ongoing compliance with the contract's security provisions\no. in alignment with CCM control STA-12, requirements for the CSP to establish and manage the security requirements of its suppliers\np. any requirements related to contract termination and transition, such as portability and data return expectations\n\nTogether, the controls and SSRM provide sound mechanisms for verifying that all requisite security requirements are addressed in the contract agreement.\n",

Each party, CSP and CSC is responsible for the remediation of vulnerabilities identified within the assets they own and securely manage.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nApplicable to all service models:\nVulnerability prioritization is a critical security control for CSPs to effectively manage and mitigate security risks in cloud environments. By prioritizing vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation, CSPs can focus their resources on the most critical threats and reduce the overall attack surface of their cloud infrastructure.\n\nFor all identified vulnerabilities on the host infrastructure, network devices, virtualization technologies, operating systems, platform applications such as databases, and web applications, the CSP should use a risk-based model for effective prioritization of vulnerability remediation using an industry-recognized framework, such as but not limited to: CVSS, the OWASP risk rating methodology, etc.\n\nVulnerabilities should be prioritized in terms of their relative risk, importance, organizational impact, and urgency. When evaluating impact, the CSP should consider exposure levels to applicable threats from its specific usage and/or implementation. When evaluating importance, the CSP should consider the criticality and value of the affected assets. Finally, when assessing urgency, the CSP should consider the CVSS ratings and timeframes, the relevance to current and ongoing threats, and the effort required for remediation.\n\nImplementation best practices for vulnerabilities prioritization include (but not be limited to):\na. Risk-based Vulnerabilities Prioritization: \ni. Vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to the cloud organization should be prioritized first, based on their severity, likelihood of exploitation, and potential impact\nii. A vulnerability prioritization matrix can be used to guide decision-making and ensure a consistent approach to vulnerability management\nb. Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): CVSS should be integrated into the vulnerabilities management process and used for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and exploitability. With CVSS, CSPs can objectively prioritize vulnerabilities and make informed decisions about remediation efforts\nc. Threat Intelligence Feeds: Threat intelligence feeds provide real-time information about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits and should be integrated into the vulnerability management processes to dynamically prioritize vulnerabilities\nd. Asset Criticality: Vulnerabilities prioritization should consider the criticality of the assets affected (i.e., Assets with higher criticality, such as those that store sensitive data or support critical business functions, should be prioritized for remediation)\ne. Remediation Workflows: CSPs should establish clear remediation workflows to ensure that prioritized vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively\nf. Prioritization Effectiveness: The effectiveness of vulnerability prioritization strategies should be continuously measured (e.g., by tracking remediation times), to help refine prioritization criteria and improve overall security effectiveness\ng. CSCs Collaboration: The CSP should collaborate with the CSCs to understand their specific security requirements and priorities in order to tailor its vulnerability prioritization strategies to better align with CSC needs and risk tolerance\nh.Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: The CSP should continuously monitor and adopt evolving cloud security best practices, including those related to vulnerability prioritization\n",

Understand the SaaS CSP's vulnerability management (VM) program: The maturity and effectiveness of the SaaS vendor's VM program should be assessed and understood. This includes understanding their vulnerability scanning frequency, prioritization criteria, remediation processes, and communication protocols.\nb. Vulnerability Disclosure and Remediation: The CSPs's responsibilities for vulnerability disclosure, remediation timelines, and communication procedures should be understood. Ensure that the vendor's service level agreement (SLA) includes specific commitments related to vulnerability management\nc. Vulnerability Reports and Remediation Progress: Vulnerability reports provided by the SaaS CSP should be regularly reviewed and their progress tracked in remediating critical vulnerabilities. This information should be used to assess the vendor's responsiveness and overall VM effectiveness\nd. Independent Vulnerability Scans: Conducting independent vulnerability scans on the SaaS application should be considered to supplement the CSP's scanning efforts. This can provide additional assurance and identify any vulnerabilities that may have been missed by the vendor's scans\ne. CSC Risk Tolerance: The severity of vulnerabilities should be assessed based on SaaS CSC risk tolerance and the potential impact on its business. Vulnerabilities that affect critical data should be prioritized, essential business functions supported, when posing a high likelihood of exploitation.\nf. SaaS CSP Communication: Maintain open communication with the SaaS vendor regarding vulnerabilities. Share your prioritization criteria and collaborate on remediation plans to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively\ng. Third-party Vulnerability Management: Using third-party vulnerability management services should be considered to provide an independent assessment of the SaaS application's security posture and identify potential vulnerabilities\nh. Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities: Security advisories and threat intelligence feeds should be continuously monitored to stay up-to-date on emerging threats and vulnerabilities that could affect the SaaS application\ni. Vulnerability Prioritization Strategy Update: As the CSC business needs and the threat landscape evolve, the vulnerability prioritization strategy should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it aligns with the current risk tolerance and security requirements\n\nBy following these steps, SaaS CSCs can effectively prioritize vulnerabilities, reduce security risks, and protect their data and business operations from potential threats.\nNote: Under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and based on contractual agreement, the CSC may be able to request from the CSP a summary of identified vulnerabilities on the application they consume, and how they are tracked and verified following remediation.\n\nApplicable to all service models:\nThe implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.\n",
