","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control's implementation responsibility is independent of the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) since GRC is applicable to all. It is shared and should be implemented by each party, CSC and the CSP, however independently from one another. Both entities may have different screening policies and processes that they should fill respective of their countries, contractual and regulatory requirements.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP is responsible for implementing internal measures to ensure that permanent and temporary staff, outsourced consultants and any other third-party service providers have been appropriately screened and vetted in relation to the level, amount and frequency of access to systems or sites required by their role. The screening processes should be established and precede any activity in granting access to systems. 

Screening processes should be conducted by authorized and specialized departments to compartmentalize any and all personal data/sensitive information gathered during the screening processes. The CSP should make reasonable arrangements to assure the CSC of staff trust level. Where appropriate, it should conduct client-specific screening to their requirements for staff with access to the CSC's systems such as government or law enforcement agencies. In situations where screening is delayed, for example, the inability to contact references or verification checks taking a long time, should implement mitigating controls for the interim, such as:
a. Delaying start date or onboarding
b. Not issuing access or credentials
c. Allowing access but limiting or restricting permissions

Where circumstances cause complications, or screening has detected previous issues such as criminal records or information that causes concern, processes should be in place to escalate matters or to terminate offers of employment.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: the scope and objectives of background verification, including the types of positions, roles, and access levels of employees, contractors, and third parties that require background checks.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP bears the responsibility for fostering a security culture within its organization, safeguarding itself and its clients from both accidental and malicious activities.

A clear desk policy is a fundamental component of information security, ensuring the physical protection of sensitive data from theft. This policy mandates the secure storage of assets in designated furniture, safes, and lockers, effectively shielding sensitive information from unauthorized access. Additionally, it safeguards against overlooking, shoulder surfing, and potential malicious activity by enforcing screen locks, thereby reducing the risk of session capturing, particularly in virtualized environments.

To further enhance security, whiteboards, writable walls, and other writable surfaces, along with notebooks, post-it notes, and similar materials, should be cleared, securely shredded, or wiped clean when not in use. Mobile devices and desktops may be equipped with physical cable locks to prevent theft, while servers and sensitive equipment should be stored within secured racks or cages.

When sending documents to printers, then these documents should be retrieved promptly to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all workspaces, including physical workstations, laptops, mobile devices, and cloud-based workspaces in order to protect data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information for all employees, contractors, and third parties that leave their workspaces unattended

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Remote and Home working policy should be deployed by the CSP where it permits those activities for its personnel. Remote working increases the risk and threat profile of a cloud organization as these boundaries of protection may become weakened or assets may be compromised through various means. The CSP has a responsibility to protect its core systems and its CSC's data. The policy should be defined and deployed to provide its personnel the appropriate security requirements, controls and procedures to follow while they work remotely.

Personnel should be trained and informed of risks when working remotely, as the shift to a decentralized work environment introduces various cybersecurity threats that individuals must be vigilant against. 

One prevalent risk is the increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. Additionally, the use of unsecured Wi-Fi networks in home environments poses a potential threat, as it opens avenues for unauthorized access and data interception. Remote workers should also be cautious about the security of their devices, as the loss or theft of laptops or mobile devices can lead to unauthorized access to corporate data. Furthermore, the reliance on personal devices and unsecured applications for work tasks may expose organizations to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information.
