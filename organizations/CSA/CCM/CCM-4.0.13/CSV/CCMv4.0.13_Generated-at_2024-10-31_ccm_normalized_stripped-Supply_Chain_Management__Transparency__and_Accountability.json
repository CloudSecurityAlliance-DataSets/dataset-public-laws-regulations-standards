        "Implementation Guidelines_CCM Implementation Guidelines v2.0 CSP": "Control Ownership Rationale.\nThe CSC and CSP should independently establish and maintain their own SSRM shared but independent policies and procedures.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nApplicable to all service models:\nThe SSRM is pivotal in ensuring comprehensive and effective cybersecurity risk management. The CSC and CSP jointly engage in implementing, managing, and monitoring the cloud services. The various controls (e.g., from the CCM) should be performed by one party or the other, by both parties independently, or by both parties in a dependent manner. \n\nThe SSRM serves as the key mechanism to:\na. comprehensively elaborate the controls necessary to implement, use, manage, and monitor the cloud services in a secure manner\nb. establish and document a common agreement between the CSP and CSC about their respective responsibilities and expectations regarding the controls\nc. serve as the basis for contractual service agreement and ongoing contractual management and compliance \nd. support effective ongoing control execution, management, monitoring, and assessment activities\ne. facilitate rapid and effective IR and management through clear delineation of responsibilities and communication protocols\nf. foster transparency regarding responsibilities and relationship expectations\n\nOther parties engaged by the CSP or CSC may also be involved in supporting the delivery of cloud services. For example, a SaaS service provided by one CSP may involve the use of another CSP to provide underlying IaaS services. The security responsibilities of any supporting service providers in the supply chain should also be reflected in the SSRM.\n\nGiven the SSRM's critical role in supporting effective cloud security practices, the CSC and CSP should establish and maintain policies and procedures for the application of the SSRM across their respective cloud services. This ensures consistency and adequate coverage across all services. \n\nThe specific SSRM policies and procedures needed for the CSP or CSC may be influenced by a number of factors. They should align with and augment broader organizational policies and procedures for procurement and contract management, third-party risk management, and cybersecurity risk management to adequately address the unique considerations and risks of cloud services. \n\nFurther, the rigor and comprehensiveness of an organization's SSRM policies and procedures should be commensurate with the risks, complexity, and criticality of the cloud services it uses or provides. For example, the SSRM policies and procedures of a CSC that uses a few non-critical SaaS services do not need to be as extensive and rigorous as a CSC whose business fundamentally relies on extensive IaaS. Additionally, the CSC's expectations for security program management will drive the scope and rigor of the SSRM policies and procedures.\n\nThe CSP's policies and procedures should recognize and take into consideration the many CSP- and CSC-specific circumstances that may arise in their cloud service implementations. In particular, exceptions to policies and procedures should be formally managed and approved at the appropriate level of management. This guidance is particularly relevant to contractual commitments between the parties that engender potentially more risk to the CSP or CSC (e.g., compromises a small organization may need to make due to lack of negotiating leverage). \n\nThe SSRM policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with the evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks. Updates should consider and incorporate lessons learned from the CSP's own cloud service implementations, as well as current industry standards and guidance (e.g., current CCM versions and implementation guidelines).  Additionally, if a significantly large, complex, and/or business-critical cloud services implementation is contemplated, the CSP may first want to review existing SSRM policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the anticipated risks and complexity.\n\nThe need to implement and maintain SSRM policies and procedures is the same for all cloud service models, however there may be differences in the specific procedures needed for different cloud service models or for specialized cloud services obtained (e.g., IDaaS).  For example, the SSRM procedures employed to manage an IaaS implementation may be more extensive than for a SaaS implementation given the greater responsibilities placed on the CSC under the IaaS model.\n\nPolicies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\na. organizational SSRM risk management objectives\nb. integration and alignment of SSRM policy and procedures with procurement, legal, third-party risk management, and cyber risk management policies and procedures\nc. how the SSRM is integrated and aligned with service contracts\nd. roles and responsibilities for SSRM implementation across the cloud implementation lifecycle (i.e., in due diligence, contracting, implementation, management and monitoring, and service termination)\ne. definition of risk levels applicable to the extent and rigor of due diligence, management, and monitoring activities and procedures\nf. how the SSRM is reviewed, validated, and maintained in collaboration with the CSP over the lifecycle of a cloud service implementation (e.g., by different risk levels)\ng. how exceptions to SSRM policy and/or issues and exceptions with respect to the allocation or performance of responsibilities are identified and managed\nh. reporting requirements for SSRM program activities and performance\ni. approval levels required for SSRM-related decisions\n",

The CSP and CSC should review their supply chain agreement, and the associated SSRM for the services, at least annually (see STA-10). The SSRM should be updated as necessary to address any changes or clarifications in the shared security responsibilities. If an SSRM requires an update, the CSP should determine if the update is specific to a given CSC implementation, or if the SSRM for the service offering at large should be updated (see STA-03).\n\nThe CSP may choose to implement automated tools or reporting to facilitate the ongoing monitoring and management of the SSRM or the underlying service's controls.\n\nThe need for the CSP and CSC to document, implement, and maintain the SSRM for a cloud service implementation remains the same for all cloud service models.

An expectation established in the SSRM in the sales or due diligence phases leading up to contract may have no force or effect if not captured in the contract.

The CSC may also have template provisions drafted that address its specific requirements or regulatory expectations. Attorneys (either inside counsel or outside counsel) will likely be involved in the negotiating process and review of the final document before signature. It is advisable to engage legal counsel that has prior experience with cloud service agreements and information security matters.\nb. Common SSRM and Security Provisions: Depending on the cloud service model, nature and scope of the specific services involved, and the distribution of security responsibilities, the contract may address many of the CCM control domains.
