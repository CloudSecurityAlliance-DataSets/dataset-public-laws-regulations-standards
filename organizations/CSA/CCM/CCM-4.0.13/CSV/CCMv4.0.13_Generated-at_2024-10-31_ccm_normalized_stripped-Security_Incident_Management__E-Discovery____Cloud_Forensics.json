Shared responsibilities should become identified with the use of Key Shared Security Responsibility Indicators (KSSRI) or Key Shared Cloud Security Responsibility Indicator (KSCSRI) where possible.\n\nPolicies, procedures, and supporting systems should incorporate provisions concerning the chain of custody for forensic evidence, so that such evidence becomes legally admissible.\n\nThe CSP is responsible for establishing and following company policies, resource management, regulatory and insurance requirements set forth with regards to managing incidents or performing eDiscovery and forensics-based investigations. The CSP is not responsible for maintaining knowledge of, or carrying out forensics investigations on behalf of the CSC. Nevertheless, the CSP should collaborate with the CSC during the forensic-based investigations, specifically in cases where incidents could have originated from the CSP and third-party vendors in the supply chain.\n\nThe policies and procedures should include the phases of the IR life cycle and indicate when the CSP should engage the CSC for security incidents that affect the CSC, as well as the frequency at which the CSP is expected to provide updates during incidents.\n\nThe CSP should communicate the Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, and Cloud Forensics Policies within the organization and may publish or share the IR policy for the CSC's awareness.\n\nPolicies should require establishing a core, qualified, and standing IR team that has the capability to assess, respond, learn, and communicate appropriately.\n\nPolicies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\na. Incident Handling Process: Time-stamped recording of activities in the IR process is necessary for metrics, SLA's, service recovery, and availability\nb. Detection:\ni. the location of the activity resulting in an incident: SaaS (e.g., api, GUI, user, data), PaaS (e.g., api, GUI, user, application, data), IaaS (e.g., api, GUI, user, application, solution stack, VM, data), or at the hypervisor, OS, compute and storage, network, or facility, and the event source logs, including which party (either the CSP or CSC) is responsible for the activity (success and/or failure) logs, as well as the availability of the logs that will be used for detection and other security incident management phases\nii. implementation of advanced detection tools (behavioral and rule-based) with automated alerting should be used by both the CSP and CSC to provide early detection and indication of potential incidents, as well as mechanisms for end user and third-party detection of incidents to be self-reported via ticket, email, telephoning help desk, or other available channels\nc. Analysis: \ni. policy and process should follow an attack vector taxonomy process which may include referencing the Mitre ATT&CK IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS tactics and techniques. \nii. incident scope, type, impact (functional and informational), and severity should be defined, including the data classification (e.g., personal data, Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Health) involved in the incident\niii. major incidents related to data breach, DDoS, malware, Data Leakage (DL), exploit types, local vs. remote, internal vs. external, perimeter, management plane incidents, and expected IR steps and consequences should be understood and demonstrated where the CSC's cloud environment is affected\niv. reference to consulted Incident classification and categorization techniques from organization-approved sources (e.g., US-CERT Federal Incident Notification Guidelines or FedRAMP Incident Communications Procedures). The CSC can obtain CSP support via the CSP's Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT)\nd. Containment: \ni. the most common containment techniques (e.g., network, filtering, routing, firewall and port rule changes to deny traffic, traffic filtering or isolation) are usually the responsibility of the CSP and can be automated with capable SIEM/SOAR, logic apps, and workbooks, unless it is a CSP-provided security group firewall which would be the CSC's responsibility\nii. the CSP should contain the security incident by reducing or removing the attacker's ability to continue to exploit the functionality. \niii. the CSP should ensure that forensic evidence is not compromised and that a read-only backup or creating a snapshot should be taken (e.g., cloud block-storage snapshot)\niv. The CSP should follow guidelines on managing the chain of custody for forensic evidence collected from affected systems, devices, cloud services, applications, and personnel. These policies, procedures, and supporting systems should result in legally admissible evidence\ne. Eradication: \ni. the responsibility for addressing the root cause and returning the environment to a safe state needs to be defined between the CSP and CSC, or indicate where it is shared (e.g., removing malware could be the responsibility of both the CSP and the CSC)\nii. the responsibility for closing exposures, removing or resetting credentials, performing key rotation/revocation, stopping an instance, moving to a secure resource, restricting privilege access, ensuring least privilege, need to know and need to use principles should be updated accordingly\nf. Recovery:\ni. restoring from backups, depending on the backup strategy if within the same CSP or another CSP, should be indicated in the policy and follow BCP or DR plans to maintain prioritized sequential restoration and recovery of resources\nii. Both the CSP and CSC will need to meet the changing needs of the scalable environment with adaptable RTO/RPO capabilities when resources delivering the services have expanded dynamically as with auto scaling groups, increased storage, and increased data consumption. \niii. responsibilities for rebuilding systems and allocation of resources to achieve recovery, and for ensuring the security of the recovered environment will need to be defined between the CSP and CSC\ng. Post-Mortem: Recommend configuration changes to the environment to prevent or mitigate future incidents where the CSP and CSC agree, include lessons learned, and KPIs defined and implemented for IR processes and training\nh. Response Time Agreement: \ni. Agree on severity and response time for security incidents between the CSP and CSC where shared responsibility is agreed\nii. Organization-approved industry standards should be consulted\ni. Communication Path with CSC: define the following prior to security incidents in the policies and procedures:\nj. Reporting path: which security incident types should be reported to the CSC\nk. Escalation path:  the escalation path with the CSC prior to a security incident\nl. Notification path: automate where possible, via a security incident management tool, or an alerting service via email. An out-of-band notification path may need to be defined. The IR policy and procedures should include notification requirements and timelines as per regulatory and legal requirements, especially \"Breach Notification\" requirements. Reference the Federal Incident Notification Guidelines where applicable\nm. IR Plan Testing: Test the IR plan periodically, either through paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation with the participation of both the CSP and CSC as well as other relevant parties\nn. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite\ni. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures\nii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained\no.

CSP-CSC Collaboration: Address personnel designated to report incidents between the CSP and CSC, the timeframes established, and agreed-upon impact and severity rating applicable to the CSC and CSP for incident management practices. This ensures that an incident categorized by the CSP or CSC does not negate or dictate the appropriate response to contain and eradicate the incident, or cause variations in the understanding of the appropriate response from either party (e.g., a personal data breach requires shorter response time than a DDoS attack), the frequency to provide reports throughout the incident lifecycle, and how the incident should be reported\nb. Roles and Responsibilities: Clear roles and responsibilities of the personnel in the entire incident and event management lifecycle should be defined\nc. Proactive Measures: aim to reduce IR time by including preventative measures following a defense-in-depth strategy, least privilege, need-to-know, need-to-use, and zero trust models where possible, as some defense mechanisms will be available from the CSP as part of the service or at a cost to the CSC\nd. IR Automation SOAR: address automation with a Security Orchestration and Automation Response (SOAR) solution to reduce the time to alert, contain, remediate, and eradicate the incident automatically, (e.g., when a malware attack is detected, quarantine the impacted systems, then either clean them automatically, reimage them, or perform other activities as programmed in the SOAR). The CSP will need to define what automated responses can be provided to the CSC where SOAR technology is used\ne. IR Containment: define roles between the CSC and CSP for containment strategy. Also, predetermined criteria informing how to contain the incident should be defined in the procedures to ensure timely and cost effective containment and management. Use of KSCSRIs may assist with ensuring CSP and CSC have awareness of their containment responsibilities\nf. Evidence Cloud Storage: consider the use of either a separate cloud account or of another CSP for storage of evidence. The CSP will need to inform the CSC how to accomplish this\ng. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite\ni. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures\nii.

IR Alerting: alerting procedures should be defined and implemented within a defined time frame based on event, severity, impact, and threat intelligence\nb. IR Time: response time depending on incident severity (e.g., number of minutes/hours per severity level) as per contractual agreement or SLA\nc. investigation of the time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling, the shared responsibility to produce (through secure auditing, logging, and monitoring), collect, safely store (with encryption and integrity), and transfer information or evidence related to the incident. Use of KSCSRIs may be used to assist with identifying when responsibility changes between the CSP and CSC and vice versa if another CSP will be used to store the evidence\nd. RTO Metrics: recovery time frame based on RTO and SLAs. Use of KSCSRIs may assist with meeting these required time frames \ne. IR Records: chronological record of all activities during the incident lifecycle with indicators to notify, report, and communicate as per agreed time frames between the CSP and CSC\n\nThe CSP should communicate the Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, & Cloud Forensics, Service Management Policy and Procedures within the organization and may publish or share the Incident Response Policy with the CSC for awareness.\n",

Once the IR plan is established and documented the plan needs to be approved and communicated.\n\nThe IR plan should include the following provisions:\na. Scope: The IR plan should apply to both internal dependencies (such as IT, operations, support, and legal) and external dependencies (suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, and other third parties). The cloud services, systems, applications, users, and data that are in scope and monitored for events and incidents. Ensure the scope network and infrastructure is monitored by the CSP\nb. Incident Response Team and Stakeholders: The stakeholders include customers, law enforcement who receive information about incidents and/or can be involved in incident management\nc. Incident Tracking and Classification: Define the issue and tracking system used for recording the incident. Classify incidents by severity and urgency (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Major vs Minor), using threat intelligence, attack vector taxonomy Mitre ATT&CK for PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS tactics and techniques, and data classification for any data involved, the scope, and the impact of the incident.\nd. Response Type and Expected Response Timeframes: The plan should indicate when a manual vs. automated response is required by the CSP or CSC, the time frames to respond by (e.g., mean time to acknowledge aka MTTA), by when the CSP or CSC is required to report an incident, who is responsible for containment of the incident, and the average expected mean time to containment (MTTC).

Network incidents (PaaS, SaaS) - CSP\nxii. Host incidents (PaaS, SaaS) - CSP\nxiii. Infrastructure incidents (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) - CSP\nh. Notification and Reporting: List of personnel at the CSP and CSC, third-party personnel, and distribution lists for notification. Use internal and external websites or portals where incidents and service outage information can be published and updated regularly to advise on the status of incidents that affect major services. US-CERT (required for US federal agencies and systems operated on behalf of the federal government) serves as the federal incident response center\ni. Business Impact Assessment Information: The CSP and CSC should have BIA information for each asset, system, application, and associated classified data, with owners identified and the relevant internal departments, upstream/downstream interdependencies, services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and other business-critical relationships (such as supply chain) that may be impacted\nj. Reference Information: Information on how to determine the applicable RPO, RTO, and MTD of a particular system or set of systems for restore from backup recovery procedures to restore affected services, logs, and data as per agreements between the CSC and CSP to maintain business continuity. Outline the criteria required to select the appropriate eradication and recovery choice, e.g., restore, rebuild, replace, redirect or remove.\nk. Schedule: A schedule to review, test, evaluate, and maintain and approve the plan. Define the frequency or schedule to conduct the review, test coordination, and approve the plan. \nl. Plan Testing: Conduct a paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation where feasible with the participation of both the CSP and CSC as defined in the schedule.

Both entities may require different processes, procedures, and technical controls.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nApplicable to all service models:\nThe CSP should implement a process and procedures to report security breaches and assumed security breaches for all supporting infrastructure - virtual elastic compute, server operating systems, storage, and networking - and also middleware, development tools, BI services, database management systems, and applications configured as contractually agreed for use by the CSC.\n\nImplementation best practices for security breach notifications include (but not limited to):\na. Breach Notification Plan: \ni. What constitutes a security breach, and the types of incidents requiring notification (unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration) should be defined \nii. Breach information should be included in breach notifications and specify the nature of the breach, affected data types, potential risks, and mitigation steps taken\niii. Procedures for notifying relevant parties should be defined including impacted CSCs, regulatory bodies, and internal stakeholders, as per SLAs and relevant regulations\niv. Timeframes for notifying impacted parties based on the severity of the breach and relevant regulations should be defined (e.g., 72 hours as mandated by some data breach laws)\nb. Supply Chain Breach Notification:\ni. Vendor contracts should include provisions requiring notification of security incidents impacting the CSPs' services\nii. Breach notification procedures should adhere to data protection regulations\nc. Breach Notification Channels: Appropriate communication channels for notifying affected parties about security breaches should be established\n",

Authorities Identification:\ni. The relevant regulatory bodies should be searched for and identified in each region where the CSP operates (e.g., financial regulators, data protection authorities).\nii. Points of contact should be established within national and local law enforcement agencies in operational regions\niii. Legal jurisdictions should be identified where CSC data might be stored or processed due to international operations.\nb. Centralized Contact Repository:\ni. A secure repository should be developed containing contact information for all identified authorities (e.g., names, titles, phone numbers, email addresses, jurisdiction areas, and preferred communication methods)\nii. The repository should be updated at least annually and upon any changes in personnel or contact information within the included authorities\nc. Communication Channels:\ni. Communication protocols for each authority type should be established (e.g., secure email for regulatory bodies, dedicated hotlines for law enforcement)\nii. A process should be implemented for verifying the legitimacy of any communication received from claiming authorities\nd. Legal Counsel: Legal counsel should be considered to ensure proper procedures and data sharing protocols are followed when interacting with authorities\n",
