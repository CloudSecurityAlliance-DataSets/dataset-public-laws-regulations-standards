Threat & Vulnerability Management,Detection Updates,TVM-04,"Define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures and technical
measures to update detection tools, threat signatures, and indicators of compromise
on a weekly, or more frequent basis.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a Shared (Independent) control for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS and should be implemented and operated both by the CSP and the CSC. The types of activities, events, or states for which detection tools, signatures, and indicators of compromise are defined, implemented, and evaluated will vary across each instance of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The CSP and the CSC are independently responsible for determining which such detection specifications are necessary for their respective requirements and to ensure these are adequately defined, implemented, and operated.
For SaaS implementations, CSPs will typically be responsible for this control; however, there are specific use cases where the CSC and CSP have a shared responsibility in this area.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
To maintain an effective threat detection posture, the CSP should ensure that the latest stable version of detection tools (e.g., network firewalls, WAF, NIDS, NIPS, HIDS, HIPS, network layer distributed DDoS protection, application layer DDoS protection, anti-malware software) are installed, and threats signatures and indicators of compromise (IoC) updated on a regular basis, preferably weekly or more frequently. The CSP should ensure that relevant updates are made available for the CSC to apply.

Implementation best practices for updating detection tools, threat signatures, and indicators of compromise vulnerabilities include (but are not limited to):
a. Threat Intelligence Platform: A centralized threat intelligence platform should be implemented to aggregate and curate threat data from various sources, including internal security feeds, industry reports, external threat intelligence providers, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) to provide unified access to threat indicators, signatures, and vulnerabilities
b. Threat Data Collection and Processing: The process of collecting and processing threat data from various sources should be automated (e.g., via scripts, APIs, or dedicated threat intelligence feeds) and threat data integrated into the threat intelligence platform for analysis and correlation
c. Threat Prioritization Criteria: Criteria for prioritizing threat data should be established and based on factors such as the severity of the threat, the potential impact on cloud infrastructure and CSCs data
d. Threat Signatures and Update Framework: A framework should be created for updating threat signatures for detection tools. This framework should include:
i. Continuous monitoring of threat intelligence feeds and internal security logs for new threats and IoCs
ii. Analysis of newly identified threats to determine their relevance to the CSP's cloud environment and CSC base
iii. Updates of threat signatures and IoCs based on the analysis of new threats
iv. Testing and validation of new signatures and IoCs before deployment to ensure they accurately detect threats without causing false positives
e. Detection Tools Updates: Updates for detection tools should be regularly scheduled and such tools should be configured to automatically receive updates from the vendor or threat intelligence platform (e.g., IDS/IPS tools, anti-malware software, firewalls) 
f. Version Control for Signatures and IoCs: A version control process for threat signatures and IoCs should be maintained to track changes and facilitate rollbacks if necessary. A version control system (e.g., Git) can be used to manage and store signatures and IoCs
g. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: 
i. The effectiveness of detection tools and the impact of updates on system performance and resource utilization should be continuously monitored. Metrics should be used to measure the success of the threat detection process (e.g., number of threats detected, the rate of false positives, and the time taken to respond to threats)
ii. Lessons learned from security incidents and threat analysis should be incorporated into the threat detection process
iii. Security audits and penetration testing should be regularly conducted to assess the effectiveness of the threat detection process and identify potential gaps or weaknesses. Findings should be used to refine the threat detection strategy

In addition, for SaaS implementations, CSPs will typically be responsible for this control; however, there are specific use cases where the CSC and CSP have a shared responsibility in this area.

In specific use cases, the SaaS CSC is typically responsible for determining the types of activities, events, or states for which detection tools, signatures, and indicators of compromise are desired and required and therefore need to be defined, implemented, and evaluated for a given SaaS implementation. The SaaS CSC is responsible for ensuring associated detection specifications are adequately defined, implemented, and operated. These may be accomplished in various ways, including through additional service subscription with the original CSP or through integration with the alternative services of a different third-party provider.

The CSC is, for example, often particularly responsible for defining, implementing, and evaluating processes, procedures, and technical measures to update detection tool involving appropriate application data access, data use, and data movement or exportation, and definition of appropriate or inappropriate user behavior, in relationship to their instances of the SaaS application and its associated data.

measures to identify updates for applications which use third party or open
source libraries according to the organization's vulnerability management policy.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a ""Shared (Independent)"" control for IaaS and PaaS, as in both the IaaS and PaaS service models, external libraries and the capabilities and responsibilities for the management of external libraries, including their associated vulnerabilities, can exist in both the CSP- and CSC-controlled layers. For IaaS and PaaS, this control specification therefore should be implemented by each the CSP and the CSC.

For SaaS, external libraries and the capabilities and responsibilities for the management of external libraries, including their associated vulnerabilities, exist exclusively in the CSP layer, and the CSP is solely responsible for the implementation and operation of this control.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
To effectively identify updates for applications that utilize third-party or open-source libraries, CSPs should implement a comprehensive vulnerability management strategy that encompasses the following implementation best practices:
a. Third-Party Libraries Inventory: An accurate inventory of all third-party libraries used across the cloud environment should be maintained. 
i. The inventory should include the library name, version, and associated applications
ii. Tools should be utilized to automate this process and continuously monitor for changes in library usage (e.g., software composition analysis (SCA), dependency management solutions)
b. Vulnerability Databases Integration: The inventory should be correlated with vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) to obtain timely notifications about new vulnerabilities affecting the third-party libraries used in the CSP environment
c. Patching and Deployment: The patching and deployment process for third-party libraries should be automated whenever possible
d. Open Source Library Security: When incorporating open-source libraries, follow open-source security best practices, such as reviewing the library's code, checking for known vulnerabilities, and ensuring the library is actively maintained
e. Dependency Management Tools: Employ dependency management tools to keep track of library dependencies and automatically update libraries when new versions are released
f. Automated Scanning Tools: 
i. Automated scanning tools should be employed to regularly scan applications for vulnerabilities, including those associated with third-party libraries
ii. Ensure that patching third-party libraries does not introduce new vulnerabilities or compatibility issues
g. Third-party Vendors Management: 
i. A vendor management process should be implemented to assess the security practices of third-party library vendors for adherence to your organization's security requirements
ii. A vulnerability disclosure policy should be established for external library vendors, outlining reporting procedures and timelines for vulnerability disclosure and remediation
iii. Open communication channels should be established with third-party vendors to receive timely information on vulnerabilities and updates.
h. Third Party Libraries Updates: Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to third-party libraries to stay updated on the latest vulnerabilities and patches.
i. CI/CD Integration: CI/CD pipelines should be adopted to automate the integration and deployment of new code and library updates
j. Third-party Libraries License: Compliance should be maintained with open-source licenses and legal obligations associated with third-party libraries (e.g., tracking license changes, adherence to license terms)

measures for the periodic performance of penetration testing by independent
third parties.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a ""Shared (Dependent)"" control for IaaS and PaaS, as in both the IaaS and PaaS service models, systems, resources, and technologies can exist under the control of either the CSP or CSC where the systems, resources, and technologies are potentially subject to misconfiguration, inadequate design or implementation, or inadequate control against which the performance of such a simulated attack is desirable to determine whether the vulnerability is genuine. For IaaS and PaaS, this control specification should be implemented by each the CSP and the CSC.
For SaaS, the systems, the resources, and technologies for which a penetration test is valuable exist exclusively in the CSP layer, and the CSP is solely responsible for the implementation and operation of this control.
There can be vulnerabilities within a SaaS application configuration that can be exploited as part of a penetration test and which are the responsibility of the CSC to manage and remediate; however, those are not pen testing responsibilities addressed through this control but are vulnerability management controls addressed through a number of other TVM family controls.
When conducting penetration testing in the cloud, the shared responsibility model and what penetration testing activities are permitted by the CSP should be well understood. The service level agreement will likely define the scope of testing that is allowed and how frequently it can be done. 
Irrespective of the cloud service delivery model, the CSP is responsible for defining, implementing, and evaluating processes, procedures, and technical measures for the periodic performance of penetration testing by independent third parties.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CSPs should implement a comprehensive penetration testing strategy that encompasses the following implementation best practices:

a. PenTesting Scope: 
i. The scope of penetration testing should be defined, encompassing cloud infrastructure, applications, and data storage 
ii. Objectives for each engagement should be defined, such as identifying critical vulnerabilities, assessing the effectiveness of security controls, and validating compliance with industry standards. 
iii. Limitations or constraints should be identified, such as testing hours and potential impact on production systems
b. Authorization and Notification: 
i. Formal authorization should be obtained from senior management and ensure alignment with the cloud penetration testing policy

d. Engagement Procedures: Engagement procedures should be established that outline the process from planning and authorization to execution and reporting. Specify communication channels, timelines, and deliverables
e. Non-Production Environment: A non-production environment should be utilized to conduct penetration testing to minimize disruption to live services and protect sensitive data. The non-production environment should replicate the production environment to provide realistic testing scenarios
f. Data Handling and Privacy: Data anonymization techniques or sanitized data sets should be implemented and used to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information
g. PenTesting Methodology: The penetration testing engagement should be initiated by coordinating with the CSP's security team and relevant stakeholders. Industry-standard penetration testing methodologies include OWASP, NIST, or PTES
i. Thorough reconnaissance should be conducted to gather information about the cloud environment, including its architecture, configurations, and potential vulnerabilities.
ii. Open-source intelligence (OSINT), vulnerability scanners, and network mapping tools should be utilized and identified vulnerabilities analyzed to assess their severity and potential impact
iii. Proofs-of-concept (PoCs) are recommended to exploit identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate their real-world impact

vii. The closure of reported vulnerabilities should be monitored and timely implementation of mitigation strategies ensured
viii. Follow-up penetration testing engagements should be scheduled to verify the effectiveness of remediation efforts and identify any newly introduced vulnerabilities
h. PenTesting Results Communication: The results of penetration testing should be communicated to senior management and CSCs providing insights into security enhancements and improvements
i. Continuous Improvement:
i. Cloud penetration testing processes should be periodically reviewed and updated based on evolving security threats, cloud technologies, and industry best practices. The scope, objectives, and engagement procedures should be continuously refined to ensure the program remains effective
ii. Metrics should be defined to measure the success of the cloud penetration testing program, such as the number of vulnerabilities identified, the percentage of vulnerabilities remediated, and the overall improvement in cloud security posture

There will almost certainly be limits on performing penetration tests without the permission of the CSP. The CSP and CSC should ensure that the scope of penetration tests is limited to the boundaries that each is responsible for.

Threat & Vulnerability Management,Vulnerability Prioritization,TVM-08,"Use a risk-based model for effective prioritization of vulnerability
remediation using an industry recognized framework.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility for this control is shared between both parties CSP and CSC, and both are independently responsible for implementing a risk-based model for vulnerability prioritization according to their own business needs and compliance requirements, and irrespectively of the cloud service delivery models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS). Each party, CSP and CSC is responsible for the remediation of vulnerabilities identified within the assets they own and securely manage.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Vulnerability prioritization is a critical security control for CSPs to effectively manage and mitigate security risks in cloud environments. By prioritizing vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation, CSPs can focus their resources on the most critical threats and reduce the overall attack surface of their cloud infrastructure.

For all identified vulnerabilities on the host infrastructure, network devices, virtualization technologies, operating systems, platform applications such as databases, and web applications, the CSP should use a risk-based model for effective prioritization of vulnerability remediation using an industry-recognized framework, such as but not limited to: CVSS, the OWASP risk rating methodology, etc.

Vulnerabilities should be prioritized in terms of their relative risk, importance, organizational impact, and urgency. When evaluating impact, the CSP should consider exposure levels to applicable threats from its specific usage and/or implementation. When evaluating importance, the CSP should consider the criticality and value of the affected assets. Finally, when assessing urgency, the CSP should consider the CVSS ratings and timeframes, the relevance to current and ongoing threats, and the effort required for remediation.

Implementation best practices for vulnerabilities prioritization include (but not be limited to):
a. Risk-based Vulnerabilities Prioritization: 
i. Vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to the cloud organization should be prioritized first, based on their severity, likelihood of exploitation, and potential impact
ii. A vulnerability prioritization matrix can be used to guide decision-making and ensure a consistent approach to vulnerability management
b. Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): CVSS should be integrated into the vulnerabilities management process and used for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and exploitability. With CVSS, CSPs can objectively prioritize vulnerabilities and make informed decisions about remediation efforts
c. Threat Intelligence Feeds: Threat intelligence feeds provide real-time information about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits and should be integrated into the vulnerability management processes to dynamically prioritize vulnerabilities
d. Asset Criticality: Vulnerabilities prioritization should consider the criticality of the assets affected (i.e., Assets with higher criticality, such as those that store sensitive data or support critical business functions, should be prioritized for remediation)
e. Remediation Workflows: CSPs should establish clear remediation workflows to ensure that prioritized vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively
f. Prioritization Effectiveness: The effectiveness of vulnerability prioritization strategies should be continuously measured (e.g., by tracking remediation times), to help refine prioritization criteria and improve overall security effectiveness
g. CSCs Collaboration: The CSP should collaborate with the CSCs to understand their specific security requirements and priorities in order to tailor its vulnerability prioritization strategies to better align with CSC needs and risk tolerance
h.Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: The CSP should continuously monitor and adopt evolving cloud security best practices, including those related to vulnerability prioritization
","Control Ownership Rationale.

Implementation Guidelines.
For all identified vulnerabilities on virtual machines, platform applications, the CSC should use a risk-based model for effective prioritization of vulnerability remediation using an industry-recognized framework such as but not limited to: CVSS, OWASP risk rating methodology, EPSS, SSVC, etc.

SaaS CSCs should consider prioritizing vulnerabilities on the SaaS application as part of the cloud service they consume to protect their data, maintain business continuity, and comply with security regulations.

Here are some key steps SaaS CSCs should take to prioritize vulnerabilities:
a. Understand the SaaS CSP's vulnerability management (VM) program: The maturity and effectiveness of the SaaS vendor's VM program should be assessed and understood. This includes understanding their vulnerability scanning frequency, prioritization criteria, remediation processes, and communication protocols.
b. Vulnerability Disclosure and Remediation: The CSPs's responsibilities for vulnerability disclosure, remediation timelines, and communication procedures should be understood. Ensure that the vendor's service level agreement (SLA) includes specific commitments related to vulnerability management
c. Vulnerability Reports and Remediation Progress: Vulnerability reports provided by the SaaS CSP should be regularly reviewed and their progress tracked in remediating critical vulnerabilities. This information should be used to assess the vendor's responsiveness and overall VM effectiveness
d. Independent Vulnerability Scans: Conducting independent vulnerability scans on the SaaS application should be considered to supplement the CSP's scanning efforts. This can provide additional assurance and identify any vulnerabilities that may have been missed by the vendor's scans
e. CSC Risk Tolerance: The severity of vulnerabilities should be assessed based on SaaS CSC risk tolerance and the potential impact on its business. Vulnerabilities that affect critical data should be prioritized, essential business functions supported, when posing a high likelihood of exploitation.
f. SaaS CSP Communication: Maintain open communication with the SaaS vendor regarding vulnerabilities. Share your prioritization criteria and collaborate on remediation plans to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively
g. Third-party Vulnerability Management: Using third-party vulnerability management services should be considered to provide an independent assessment of the SaaS application's security posture and identify potential vulnerabilities
h. Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities: Security advisories and threat intelligence feeds should be continuously monitored to stay up-to-date on emerging threats and vulnerabilities that could affect the SaaS application
i. Vulnerability Prioritization Strategy Update: As the CSC business needs and the threat landscape evolve, the vulnerability prioritization strategy should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it aligns with the current risk tolerance and security requirements

By following these steps, SaaS CSCs can effectively prioritize vulnerabilities, reduce security risks, and protect their data and business operations from potential threats.
