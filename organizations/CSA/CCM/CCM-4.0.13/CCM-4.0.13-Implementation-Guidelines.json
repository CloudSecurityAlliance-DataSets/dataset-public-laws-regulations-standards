Both the CSP and CSC are responsible for independently defining and implementing a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) process for secure application design, development, deployment, and operation in accordance with system security requirements defined by each cloud party.\n For deployments within the SaaS model, this control resides with the CSP, since SaaS CSPs typically offer ready-to-use applications and services, while the SaaS CSC consumes the service and is not responsible for implementing a SSDLC for application development.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n CSPs should leverage an SSDLC process to ensure that applications and APIs are securely designed, developed, deployed, and operated in their cloud environments. Integration of security best practices throughout the entire development lifecycle, can help CSPs to effectively protect their applications from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks.\n \n Defining security requirements should be the first step in the SSDLC process to ensure that security is integrated throughout all phases of development. Security requirements should derive from security objectives and/or organizational goals and regulatory requirements. Industry standards should be applied at project inception and every stage of the SSDLC process. To successfully promote SSDLC security, roles and expectations should be clearly defined, published and communicated to relevant stakeholders.\n \n The following best practices should be followed when implementing an SSDLC:\n a. SSDLC Governance: A security governance framework should be implemented that is tailored to the SSDLC and that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability for security throughout the SSDLC\n i. The CSP’s SSDLC processes, at a minimum, should meet the regulatory and CSC’s business requirements\n ii. The CSP should provide information to CSCs about the SSDLC to the extent compatible with their disclosure policies\n b. DevSecOps: A DevSecOps approach should be defined and implemented that integrates security practices into all stages of the SSDLC, from planning and design to development, testing, deployment, and operation, rather than being an afterthought\n c. Threat Modeling: Threat modeling should be incorporated into the early stages of the SSDLC to identify potential security risks and design mitigation strategies to help developers anticipate and proactively address security issues, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced later in the development cycle\n d. Secure Coding Practices: \n i. Comprehensive security design requirements should be defined that specify the security measures and controls to be implemented throughout the application's architecture\n ii. Industry standard (OWASP, etc) secure coding guidelines should be incorporated in the SSDLC\n iii. Secure coding guidelines should be followed and implemented respectively (e.g., proper implementation and configuration of security headers, input validation, information output handling, error handling, and proper use of cryptographic libraries)\n e. Open Source Components Secure Use: Secure practices for managing open-source components should be employed, including thorough vulnerability scanning, dependency management, and continuous monitoring for known vulnerabilities. Use trusted open-source repositories and ensure proper attribution and licensing compliance\n f. Vulnerability Management: Continuously scan for and remediate vulnerabilities in code, infrastructure, and third-party components (refer to TVM domain)\n g. Security Testing: Regular security audits, static, dynamic application security testing, and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential security weaknesses (refer to AIS-05 and TVM-06)\n h. Secure Deployment and Configuration Management:\n i. Secure deployment and configuration management practices should be implemented to ensure that cloud-based applications are deployed and configured in a secure manner\n ii. Automated tools should be used to enforce consistent configurations and monitor for deviations from security policies\n i. EoL Process: When an application reaches its end-of-life, a CSP should at minimum:\n i. Notify CSCs of the EoL date and provide clear instructions on how to migrate to alternative services\n ii. Discontinue providing technical support and updates for the application and archive the application's source code and documentation\n iii. Ensure that all application associated data is properly deleted or transferred to the CSC's designated location\n iv. Review and assess potential security vulnerabilities during the decommissioning process\n \n The CSPs should be transparent about their security practices and provide CSCs with the necessary tools and support to meet their security requirements. The CSCs should actively engage with CSPs to ensure that their security requirements are implemented and maintained throughout the SSDLC.",

SSDLC and Testing Management: The development team should follow the SSDLC with security best practices to create code that is secure by design, as well as use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify security loopholes present in the code\n b. Continuous CI/CD Testing: Continuous testing should be built into CI/CD pipelines: \n i. Understand that CI/CD is just not delivering the code, rather also an opportunity to adopt a “shift-left” approach with continuous testing\n ii. Pre-commit and post-commit hooks should be implemented and used\n iii. A vulnerability scanner should be used to identify any third-party library issues\n iv. An automated scanner should be used to identify hardcoded / default secrets, including access keys, secret key, credentials, private keys, etc.\n c. Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST should be used to analyze the application's source code, bytecode, or binary code to detect issues early in the development lifecycle and identify security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers (e.g., data/control flow, taint analysis)\n d. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): DAST should be used to test the application in its running state to identify security vulnerabilities by sending requests and analyzing the responses (e.g., fuzz testing, session hijacking, injection testing)\n e. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST): IAST should be used to combine elements of both SAST and DAST, identify security issues without the need for source code access, and provide real-time feedback on security vulnerabilities during the application's runtime\n f. Penetration Testing: Penetration tests should be performed to simulate real-world cyberattacks to identify potential vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of the security measures in place\n g. Input Validation: Input validation test cases should be used to identify injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Command Injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This includes checking the type, format, length, and range of input data to ensure that it adheres to predefined criteria and does not contain any malicious or unauthorized content\n h. Information Output Handling: Information output filtering test cases should be used to identify information exfiltration attacks (e.g., cleartext output of passwords)\n i. Industry Best Practices: Security test cases should be employed according to OWASP Top 10. Consider also aligning test cases with various compliance standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, AICPA TSC) depending on organizational strategy and requirements\n j. Continuous Monitoring: Continuous monitoring should be required once an application is deployed to test for a crash, DoS, DDoS, unauthenticated scans, etc.\n k. Applications Testing Automation: \n i. The test team should leverage automation to expedite the testing completion process and for efficacy in reducing errors and surfacing security gaps\n ii. Automated tools should test applications for both known and unknown vulnerabilities\n iii.

Consequently, the CSC should ensure that the criteria for upgrades, modifications, or acceptance of new systems and versions align with their organizational security standards, compliance requirements, and application-specific needs. By implementing a rigorous testing strategy, the SaaS CSC can verify the compatibility, appropriate security, and proper functionality of the upgrades or new systems before their integration into the organization's workflow.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n For the IaaS and PaaS CSC, as part of a comprehensive testing strategy, the same guidelines as for the CSP apply, and additionally ensure the proper configuration, upgrades, and secure integration of new systems and new versions of systems and applications. \n \n In particular with respect to the SaaS CSC, the following implementation guidelines apply:\n a. Configuration of Applications: The SaaS customer should configure the application settings and permissions according to their specific business requirements, ensuring that access controls, user privileges, and data encryption are appropriately set up to mitigate security risks and maintain data privacy\n b. Application Upgrades: Prior to implementing any application upgrades, the SaaS customer should conduct thorough testing, including functional, compatibility, and security testing, to ensure that the upgrades do not disrupt the existing workflows or compromise the application's security posture. This also involves maintaining a rollback plan in case any issues arise during the upgrade process\n c. Secure Integration of New Systems: The SaaS customer should evaluate the compatibility of the new systems with the existing infrastructure and conduct comprehensive integration testing to ensure that data integrity, security protocols, and application functionalities are maintained throughout the integration process. Secure authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and access controls should be implemented to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities during the integration of new version systems\n \n Automation of security testing should be implemented to reduce risks and errors and enable the scaling of security practices to meet organizational demands.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to applications, steal sensitive data, and disrupt operations. CSPs play a critical role in helping CSCs remediate application security vulnerabilities.\n \n The following best practices should be followed for implementing a vulnerability remediation process:\n a. Vulnerability Remediation Scope: A process for defining the scope of a vulnerability remediation should be established (e.g., IaaS CSPs may only be responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure, while PaaS CSPs may also be responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in the platform software)\n b.

Physical and logical assets then should inherit the sensitivity level of the data they handle, hence allowing for the CSP to classify them.\n \n The CSP is responsible for:\n • Providing a secure cloud environment that meets the security requirements of the CSC’s data\n • Classifying and documenting the physical and logical assets that are used to compute, store or transmit CSC data, according to the sensitivity levels of such data\n • Implementing security controls that are appropriate for the sensitivity level of the CSC data\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n CSPs should adhere to a comprehensive approach that aligns with the data sensitivity levels defined by the CSC. This involves understanding the CSC’s data classification policy, identifying and assessing the sensitivity of data stored on each asset, implementing appropriate security controls, and continuously monitoring and auditing asset security. \n \n Additionally, CSPs should document asset classification and security controls, train employees, and leverage automated tools to streamline the process and enhance data protection measures. By adopting these best practices, CSPs can effectively safeguard sensitive data and fulfill their contractual responsibilities as trusted partners in the cloud ecosystem.\n \n Implementation best practices for the CSP to classify and document the physical, and logical assets include (but not limited to):\n a. Asset Inventory and Tracking: The CSP should leverage an inventory of all physical and logical assets that are used to store, process, or transmit CSC data (refer to DCS-06), including physical equipment, such as servers and storage devices, as well as software components, such as network assets and configurations, virtual machines, operating systems and applications\n b. Asset Classification: The CSP should assess the sensitivity of data stored on each asset based on the CSC’s data classification policy. This assessment should take into account the type of CSC data, the potential harm that could be caused if the data were breached, and the legal and regulatory requirements for protecting the data\n c. Automated Tools for Assets Classification: The CSP can use automated tools to help with asset classification and security. These tools can scan assets for vulnerabilities and identify assets that are not in compliance with the asset classification policies\n d. Assets Classification Documentation: The CSP should document the classification of each asset and the security controls that are applied to the asset. This documentation should be made available to the CSC upon request\n e. Assets Tagging: The CSPs should assign unique tags or labels to physical and logical assets to facilitate identification, tracking, and management (refer to DCS-06).\n f. Apply Security Controls: Appropriate classification levels should be applied to physical and logical assets and appropriate security protection and controls in accordance to the sensitivity of the data stored on, processed or transmitted by the cloud asset\n g.

Data Usage Patterns: Data usage patterns, such as data access frequencies, data flows, and data processing activities could be shared with the CSP. This information can help the CSP understand the context in which your data is used and make informed classification decisions over the physical and logical assets.\n c. Regulatory Compliance Requirements: The CSP should be informed about applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements that apply to CSC data, such as industry standards or government regulations. This will ensure that these requirements are taken into account by the CSP when classifying assets and implementing security controls.\n d. Change Management and Communication: Open communication channels should be maintained with the CSP regarding any changes to physical and logical assets handling CSC data, or any changes to the CSC’s data classification policy or usage patterns.

The responsibility of this control implementation is \"Shared Dependent\" since the CSP should enable the CSC to access the catalog of CSP assets that are used to compute and store CSC data. The CSC should be empowered to retrieve the list of assets. It should be within the support of the CSP to assign descriptive metadata (tags) to assets for efficient and timely tracking, cost analysis, access control decisions, and alerting (by automation where applicable).\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n The CSP should employ a comprehensive solution (e.g., CMDB) for tracking inventory and managing the physical locations of servers and other data center assets, while phasing out paper-based and manual processes. A hosted asset tracking solution for servers, switches, datacenter asset tracking, and racks usually leverages a combination of technologies, such as passive radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning system (GPS), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and/or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with hardware roots-of-trust (HROT).\n \n The CSP should maintain a list of assets the CSC is using (e.g., cloud storage) or has provisioned (e.g., VMs) and provide tools to the CSC to access the CMDB and help it identify and tag the assets that handle CSC data. For instance, the CSP should share information about the assets that are used to store the CSC’s data (as well as the means to access them).\n \n This information can then be used by the CSC to catalog, tag, and track all the cloud relevant assets and services that are provided by the CSP, and to process and store CSC data (e.g., network, computational, and storage services).\n \n An EoL (End-of-Life) tracking system for all inventoried assets should be maintained. A process should be established to gather and maintain accurate EoL information for all inventoried assets within the cloud environment (e.g., manufacturer EoL dates for hardware and software, expiration dates for software/services, patch availability timelines). \n \n Automated EoL notifications within the asset inventory system should be implemented to trigger proactive security measures like scheduling asset retirement, migrating workloads, or disabling vulnerable assets nearing their end-of-life. Such notifications should be communicated to the CSC in a timely manner for seamless integration into the CSC’s change management framework.",

A standardized naming convention is the starting point for organizing the cloud-hosted resources. The same naming conventions on tags should be consistently used across multiple CSPs (e.g., multi-cloud environment), and where possible, cloud assets should be tracked by an automated means, allowing for prompt decisions to be made according to them (e.g., access control decisions, monitoring and alerting, accounting).\n \n Templates for defining a naming and tagging convention for tagging assets are defined by all major CSPs. The CSC may choose to adopt the CSP’s naming standards or define their own that they wish to apply to each asset type they plan to deploy as part of their cloud adoption effort.\n \n Examples of tagging conventions and respective cloud assets types that should be cataloged and tracked are below, where applicable by cloud service model (but not limited to):\n a. Asset Tags Types:\n i. Environment Tag: Identifying resources belonging to different environments such as production, development, or testing\n ii.

Security Classification Tag: Identifying the security classification or sensitivity level of resources\n viii. Compliance/Regulatory Tag: Indicate compliance with specific regulations or standards\n ix. Automation Tag: Indicate whether the asset should be selected for action by scripts, scanners or other form of automation\n x. Active Tag: Designates resources currently in use for production, development, or other relevant purposes\n xi. Deprecated Tag: Designates resources scheduled for retirement or no longer actively used\n b. Cloud Asset Types:\n i. Virtual machines (e.g., VM instances/images, OS name/version),\n ii. Virtual networking (e.g., VPC networks and subnets, DNS records, IP addresses),\n iii. Databases (e.g., database/SQL servers),\n iv. Storage (e.g., block, file, object storage types), \n v. Applications (e.g., custom applications, container images, software licenses)\n \n The catalog should include all device status changes (e.g., patch levels, lost/decommissioned status, and to whom the asset type is assigned, or approved for BYOD).\n \n Cloud asset cataloging and tracking should be prioritized to include the most security-relevant or critical ones followed by the inclusion of remaining asset types that pertain to minimal or no risk.\n \n If supported by the CSP, automated scans should be made to identify assets that are not tagged or have tagged values not aligned to CSC’s tagging rules (e.g., assets tagged or not tagged with a ‘classification level’ value).\n \n When tagging tools are not made available from the CSP, the CSC should proceed with manually tagging and cataloging assets. Easy-to-parse formats (JSON, YAML, XML) should be preferred for more efficient management and maintenance of the catalog.\n \n The CSC should map security tools to the assets included in the catalog in order to prevent, detect, recover, and respond to security risks that are applicable to them (e.g., use vulnerabilities patching and antivirus tools with VM/OS assets as preventive and detective security controls).\n \n Assets that have been tagged with a ‘Security Classification Level’ key type should inherit the highest data classification level (high-water mark) value among the different classification levels of data that the particular asset type is destined to use for performing computational, network or storage operations on such data."

This is due to the fact that either CSP or CSC may, depending on their unique requirements (e.g., regulation, end of life of storage media) may be required to securely dispose of data from storage media. \n \n This control is also Dependent since the CSP is expected to have the technological capability that supports industry accepted methods of deleting data in a way that is not retrievable when requested by the CSC, or when a storage device is at the end of its lifetime and needs to be decommissioned. \n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n a. Data Disposal Authorization: Establish authorization procedures for data disposal requests. Only authorized personnel should be able to initiate and approve such requests\n b. Restrict Access after Disposal Request: the CSP should disallow any new attempts to access data once the request for data deletion has been submitted and approved\n c. Data Disposal Options: Explore various data disposal options and select the most appropriate method based on data sensitivity, media type and regulatory requirements\n d. Off-Premise Transport Restriction: Data media storage should not be permitted to leave the organization’s premises nor be transported out of the CSP's datacenters without being sanitized or destroyed\n e. Data Destruction: Prior to physical media disposal, all data stored on such media must be completely destroyed using industry-approved methods. Implement secure data erasure procedures to render data irretrievable from storage devices. This may include physical destruction of media (e.g., hard drives demagnetization, paper shredding, etc.), data cryptographic erasure, or software-based erasure methods\n f. Cryptographic Erasure: \n i. utilize encryption to render data irretrievable, by encrypting the data and then destroying the encryption key.\n ii. the CSP should make sure that key material (including but not limited to keys, seeds, initialization vectors) is deleted in a forensically sound manner\n g. Data Sanitization: as part of the decommissioning process or based on requests by the CSC for data deletion, a secure logical or physical data deletion method on media should be used (including but not limited to zeroization, cross-cut shredding, degaussing, incineration, or pulverizing) based on industry accepted practices such as those specified in NIST SP 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization, or methods such as DOD 5220.22-M\n h. Verification of Data Destruction: Require a systematic process for verifying the successful and complete destruction of data on decommissioned media through a documented and auditable verification mechanism\n i. Certification of Equipment Disposal Vendors: Use certified data disposal vendors who adhere to recognized industry standards and provide documentation certifying the proper disposal of data\n j. Disposal Record-Keeping and Auditing: Maintain detailed records of all data disposal events into a tracking system with a digital certificate of media disposition that clearly indicates whether they have been cleared, purged, or destroyed. Records should include the date, type of data, disposal methods, dates of disposal, authorized personnel involved and verification results for audit and compliance purposes\n k. Disposal of Active and Back Up Data: data should be deleted from both active and backup storage media including but not limited to locations where temporary and obsolete files are stored\n l. Change Management for Data Disposal: all secure data disposal processes should only be carried out using a well-defined change management approval process\n m. Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations: Ensure that data disposal processes comply with all applicable data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n n. Periodic Audits and Reviews: Establish a schedule for periodic audits and reviews of data disposal processes, including both physical media disposal and data destruction, to ensure ongoing compliance and effectiveness.\n \n Note: Active storage systems are production servers, while backup storage systems are full or incremental backups/copies of active storage systems.",

        "CCM Implementation Guidelines v2.0  - Cloud Service Provider": "Control Ownership Rationale.\n The control ownership is defined as “Shared (Dependent).” Shared, because the CSP and CSC should complete privacy by design and default activities for the products and services that they wish to implement (e.g., the CSP will conduct the activity for a product or service it is going to offer the CSC, while the CSC will do the same in order to offer the product or service to its own set of stakeholders - customers, business partners, employees, third parties or the general public).\n \n Dependent, because both parties rely on each other for baking in privacy (sometimes via security control guidance specific in DSP-07). The CSP, for instance, depends on the CSC’s feedback as input to improve an existing product or service, so it can be improved in a later version. The CSC depends on the CSP because privacy by design and default requires security architects to propose options, with benefits, drawbacks, and costs to senior management stakeholders. As such, dependency on CSPs becomes vital as the CSC may not have complete knowledge of the array of products available (e.g., either on the CSP’s marketplace or natively), or how the implementation can be made in a secure manner to suit the CSC's cloud and/or hybrid ecosystem. \n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models: \n a. Before privacy by design and default activities begin, data and asset Inventory (as per control DSP-03), data classification and asset valuation (as per DSP-04), DFD and HLD at a minimum should be completed. This is recommended, as a prerequisite, in order to ensure that the security or privacy controls are commensurate with the value of the data, and the associated asset and can be executed in an efficient manner (i.e., decisions on baking in security and privacy controls are based on complete & accurate information available at hand\n b. privacy by design activities should begin with examining DFDs and the HLD at a minimum. Where possible and if available the LLD should also be reviewed\n c. as part of the activity, threat modeling should be conducted to envision which specific threat actors (the who, e.g., script kiddies, hacktivists, criminals, nation states) could attack a specific asset, their motives (e.g., money, political, espionage), and what specific threats (the method via which they could attack and what weaknesses they could exploit) pose to an asset's or data's security and/or privacy. Threat modeling can be performed using approaches or frameworks such as STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, or similar. If agile methodologies such as scrum or Kanban are being used within the organization, threat modeling can be conducted by documenting evil stories or misuse cases for every user story produced during a sprint. It is also recommended to create threat modeling diagrams that visually depict the concept of trust boundaries, isolation, threats affecting each asset, and recommended countermeasures. Threats can be classified into people, process, or technology\n d. post threat modeling, a comprehensive security pattern* detailing the security requirements, should be created. Security requirements should consider threats identified, potential weaknesses, regulatory requirements, and recommend controls for the Prevention, Detection, Response or Recovery of an asset that will store, process or transmit data. Note: NIST's Identify, Protect, Detect, Response, and Recover model has been applied here as a recommended baseline\n e. Privacy requirements should be created for all stages of the SDLC, from feasibility study to design to build to run (operationalize) to maintenance\n f. Privacy requirements should be created for every component in the design; this includes but is not limited to all technology assets in scope of the design & network connectivity between those assets\n g. Privacy requirements should cover scenarios that involve People (e.g. user education, customer education), Process (e.g. how will authorized business stakeholders access data subject to privacy regulations) & Technology (e.g. All JSON Web Tokens should contain a Scope section that ensures that every operation on data requires Authentication & Authorization from the Data subject)\n h. Privacy by design requirements should ensure that they align with regulatory requirements in the respective jurisdiction of the organization. \n \n Recommended privacy by design requirements include (but are not limited to):\n i. Data Minimization, specifically during the collection of data for the purposes of ensuring alignment to privacy regulations\n j. Privacy notices covering what data will be collected, how it will be used, who will have access to the data, with whom it will be shared or disclosed (including 3rd parties), how long it will be retained, how it will be protected,. From an implementation perspective, privacy notices can take the form of Pop-Ups, banners, layered notices or similar\n k. Additional concepts such as Consent, Choice, Collection Limitations, Data Quality, Reliable Sources, Primary & Secondary Uses, Internal & External Disclosure\n l. Data Subject Access and under what conditions it will be provided (e.g. how data subjects can access and/or export their data and how they can contact the CSP with questions or concerns around privacy)\n m. Technologies that deploy Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PET) such as Non-Perturbation (e.g. Masking, Suppression, Generalisation or Pseudonymisation), Perturbation (e.g., Noise Addition or Micro Aggregation) , Cryptography (e.g. Encryption techniques such as Homomorphic, Format Preserving, Deterministic, Order-Preserving) and Privacy Models such as k-anonymity, I-diversity or similar\n n. Rules around how data will be protected during Cross Border transfers should be considered based on regulatory requirements\n o. The default/out-of-the-box settings should align with the applicable regional privacy regulations. Examples include but are not limited to the following: \n i. explicit consent/choice based manual opt-in, wherein the data subject should manually tick a box or perform some action to explicitly consent, should be the privacy by default option available as opposed to automatic opt-in, which then requires manual opt-out by a data subject \n • Regarding cookies, only strictly necessary ones should be auto-enabled, while additional cookies of other types should be auto-disabled. Explicit consent from the data subject should be requested in the event additional cookies (other than strictly necessary cookies) need to be enabled\n • Enabled by default, graphical user interfaces (GUI) should conduct data collection (e.g., via a web form) by requesting only the absolute minimum data required (e.g., if only age range is required based on legitimate use principles, specific age should not be available in the drop down menu) aka data minimization\n • by default, privacy notices (either simple or layered) should be displayed each and every time information is requested from the data subject\n p. CSPs should ensure that MSAs with their respective sub-contractors or dependent parties contain the requisite data privacy clauses (e.g., data breach notification clauses such as \"The CSP should inform the CSC of a data breach within a reasonable timeframe/with immediacy as per required regulations or based on instruction from the CSC” (e.g., if the CSC is the data controller)\n q. Privacy by design controls should be baked into every phase of the data lifecycle, from creation to use, sharing, archival and destruction",

As a Data Controller, they are obliged, depending on certain conditions (e.g., data processing activities that could potentially result in high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals) to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The CSP performs a DPIA because personal data may be sent to the cloud from the CSC. \n \n Dependent, because the CSC may need to assess the tools and technologies available from the CSP that can be used as measures (e.g., safeguards, security mechanisms) to mitigate risk, which is one of the stages of the DPIA before recording outcomes and providing sign offs. The CSP on the other hand is dependent on the CSC, because it takes the CSC's DPIA as input, in order to understand how the CSC processes personal data. The CSP incorporates this into its security and privacy by design and default approaches by incorporating features into products and tools that they can offer other CSCs in the future so that they can meet the commitments of their DPIAs.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) should cover the following concepts: \n a. Description of the nature of data processing activities (e.g. how will data be collected, used, stored and deleted, who will it be shared with, who will have access to it, how long it will be retained)\n b. Description of the scope of the processing (e.g. nature of the data, special categories of data, volume of data that will be collected, retention periods, the extent frequency of collection, the number of data subjects involved, the duration of the processing and the geographical area covered)\n c. Description of the context of data processing (e.g. the source of the data, nature of relationship with the individual or data subject, level of control that data subjects will have, prior experiences of this type of processing, issues of public concern)\n d. Description of the purposes of data processing (e.g.legitimate interest, the objective of data processing, benefits of the processing, impact on data subject)\n e. Considerations on how to consult with relevant stakeholders (e.g., consultation from information security experts, seeking advice and counsel from specific individuals, groups or organizations)\n f. description of compliance and proportionality measures (e.g. lawful basis, ensuring data quality & minimisation)\n g. Identify & assess risks and potential impact to individuals or data subjects (e.g., likelihood - remote, possible or probable and severity - minimal, significant or catastrophic of harm and overall risk - low, medium or high). Examples of potential impacts include but are not limited to inability to exercise rights (including but not limited to privacy rights), inability to access services or opportunities, loss of control over the use of personal data, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, physical harm, re-identification of pseudonymised data; or any other significant economic or social disadvantage\n h. Identify measures(e.g. safeguards, security mechanisms or any other mechanism to ensure protection of personal data) to to reduce or eliminate inherent risks and agree on a value for the residual risk (e.g. low, medium or high). Examples of risk mitigation include but are not limited to deciding not to collect certain types of data;reducing the scope of the processing;reducing retention periods;taking additional technological security measures;training staff to ensure risks are anticipated and managed; anonymising or pseudonymising data where possible;writing internal guidance or processes to avoid risks;using a different technology;putting clear data-sharing agreements into place;making changes to privacy notices;offering individuals the chance to opt out where appropriate; or implementing new systems to help individuals to exercise their rights.\n i. Record outcomes and sign off on the measures & residual risks approved\n j. It is recommended to use DPIA templates to record the DPIA processes and outcomes. A recommended template from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) can be found at https://gdpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dpia-template-v1.pdf\n k. The DPIA should be conducted before beginning any data processing activity. It is recommended, for instance, to conduct the DPIA, before and during the planning stages of a new project or initiative\n l. DPIAs should be reviewed at least once annually OR if a change in risk is envisaged as a result of data processing\n m. Where required and necessary, the advice of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) should be taken when carrying out a DPIA. DPIAs should be carried out for both, CSC Data , Service Data (or Service-Generated Data)* & Support Data**\n \n Notes: \n It is recommended to carry out an Initial Screening Assessment (ISA) during a process such as Data Classification (at the start of a project) prior to moving on to DPIAs. This is to ensure a privacy review is conducted on how processing will work regardless, as there may be instances where a DPIA isn't deemed necessary based on there being no significant risk to data subjects, which is determined in an ISA).\n * Service data can be defined as personal information that the CSP collects or generates via the provisioning of certain services or data derived via the operation of a service (e.g. user or performance data).\n ** Support data can be defined as data provided to the CSP by the CSC to to obtain technical support for services offered by the CSP.",

Risk management for an organization is ultimately owned by that organization's leadership.\n \n An ERM program, as with all Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) topics, should be implemented at the organizational level and should be independent of the type of cloud service delivery model and irrespective of the types of cloud services provided or consumed. Cloud organizations, whether operating in a cloud service consumption or cloud service provider role, need to appropriately manage risk, and to establish a formal, documented, leadership-sponsored Enterprise Risk Management program.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is the overall management of risk for an organization. The service agreement or contract defines important elements such as the scope of services, service levels, responsibilities and obligations, among others, between a CSP and a CSC. While the contract may or may not define roles and responsibilities in detail, and may not address responsibilities for risk management, an entity can never fully outsource its ultimate responsibility and accountability for risk management to an external provider. The purpose of risk management is the creation and protection of value. The risk management process involves the systematic application of policies, procedures, and practices to the activities of communicating and consulting, establishing the context and assessing, treating, monitoring, reviewing, recording, and reporting risk. Risk for the CSP should be calculated using a risk appetite framework that defines the risk capacity or the maximum amount of residual risk it will accept after controls and other measures have been put in place.\n \n The risk management process should be an integral part of management and decision-making and integrated into the structure, operations and processes of the organization. It can be applied at strategic, operational, program, or project levels. There can be many applications of the risk management process within an organization, customized to achieve objectives and to suit the external and internal context in which they are applied. As part of the ERP program, the Information security risk management process should exist. \n \n The Information security risk management should also include cloud-relevant information security and data privacy risks when applicable to the organization. \n \n The CSP and CSP should both have information security risk management processes in place. They are advised to align to the STAR Program and other widely known cyber/cloud security frameworks and standards\n \n If the CSP uses the services of other providers,, it should ensure information security levels to the CSC are maintained or exceeded. When the CSP provides services based on a supply chain, the CSP should provide information security objectives to suppliers, and request that each of the suppliers perform risk management activities to achieve the objectives",

This policy mandates the secure storage of assets in designated furniture, safes, and lockers, effectively shielding sensitive information from unauthorized access. Additionally, it safeguards against overlooking, shoulder surfing, and potential malicious activity by enforcing screen locks, thereby reducing the risk of session capturing, particularly in virtualized environments.\n \n To further enhance security, whiteboards, writable walls, and other writable surfaces, along with notebooks, post-it notes, and similar materials, should be cleared, securely shredded, or wiped clean when not in use. Mobile devices and desktops may be equipped with physical cable locks to prevent theft, while servers and sensitive equipment should be stored within secured racks or cages.\n \n When sending documents to printers, then these documents should be retrieved promptly to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\n a. Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all workspaces, including physical workstations, laptops, mobile devices, and cloud-based workspaces in order to protect data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information for all employees, contractors, and third parties that leave their workspaces unattended\n b. Screen Locking Mechanism:\n i. Require all devices to have an automatic screen locking mechanism that activates after a defined period of inactivity (e.g., not exceeding five minutes)\n ii. Require strong passwords, PIN, or biometric authentication to unlock screens (refer to IAM-02)\n iii. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users to further enhance screen lock security\n c. Automatic Logout:\n i. Implement an automatic session logout feature after a specified period of inactivity to ensure that users are not inadvertently leaving their sessions open\n ii. automatically lock remote desktop sessions when not in use, and require secure authentication for re-entry\n d. Privacy Screens: Encourage or require the use of privacy screens on devices to limit the visibility of screens to individuals in close proximity\n e. Clear Desk Policy: employees should maintain a clean workspace, ensuring that confidential information is not openly visible when they are away from their desks. Document covers or lockable storage cabinets for sensitive documents are advised\n i. confidential documents, printouts, or notes should be not left in plain sight\n ii. confidential documents should be shred or securely disposed of when no longer needed (refer to DSP-02)\n f. Secure Physical Devices:\n i. Lock workstations, laptops, and mobile devices when left unattended, even for short periods\n ii. Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all devices\n iii. Avoid storing confidential data on removable media, such as USB drives, unless encrypted\n g. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite\n i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures\n ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained\n h.

Both entities may have different Remote and Home Working policies and Procedures which will link to the individual organizations standards and requirements within their policies and processes that they should achieve for their respective countries , contractual or regulatory requirements.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n Remote and Home working policy should be deployed by the CSP where it permits those activities for its personnel. Remote working increases the risk and threat profile of a cloud organization as these boundaries of protection may become weakened or assets may be compromised through various means. The CSP has a responsibility to protect its core systems and its CSC's data. The policy should be defined and deployed to provide its personnel the appropriate security requirements, controls and procedures to follow while they work remotely.\n \n Personnel should be trained and informed of risks when working remotely, as the shift to a decentralized work environment introduces various cybersecurity threats that individuals must be vigilant against. \n \n One prevalent risk is the increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. Additionally, the use of unsecured Wi-Fi networks in home environments poses a potential threat, as it opens avenues for unauthorized access and data interception. Remote workers should also be cautious about the security of their devices, as the loss or theft of laptops or mobile devices can lead to unauthorized access to corporate data. Furthermore, the reliance on personal devices and unsecured applications for work tasks may expose organizations to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information. \n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\n a. Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access, process, or store information accessed, processed or stored at remote sites and locations in the context of cloud computing and cloud security. Objective of policy is to ensure that remote employees are aware of and comply with the organization's cloud security policies and procedures\n b. Secure Network Connections: Require the use of a VPN for secure and encrypted communication, with strong encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms, between remote devices and the corporate network\n c. Remote Working MFA Access: Require the use of MFA for accessing corporate systems and cloud services. The use of MFA on all devices and applications to add an extra layer of security should be encouraged\n d. Endpoints Protection: Require the deployment of endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware and other security threats\n i. Implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Endpoint Management solutions for remote device configuration, monitoring, and security enforcement (e.g., anti-malware, device encryption, secure email, etc.) (refer to UEM domain)\n ii. Educate remote workers about the risks of using public Wi-Fi and recommend the use of a VPN when connecting to public networks\n iii. Provide guidelines for securing home Wi-Fi networks, including the use of strong encryption (WPA3) and changing default credentials\n e. Secure Remote Desktop Solutions: Where applicable, require the use secure remote desktop solutions with strong encryption and authentication\n f. Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks\n g. Regular Software Updates: Enable automatic updates whenever possible and educate users on the importance of keeping software up to date\n h. Remote Data Backups: Require regular backups of critical data stored on remote devices and test data restoration procedures periodically to ensure data can be recovered in case of loss or a security incident\n i. Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks.\n j. Secure Printing: Educate remote workers with secure printing practices, such as immediately retrieving printed documents with sensitive data\n k. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite\n i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures\n ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained\n l.

Specific authentication factors and technical measures should be defined and implemented for each access level, including MFA for privileged identities and sensitive data access\n b. MFA Usage Scope:\n i. Sensitive Data Access: Strong authentication should be enforced at all user accounts, requiring a combination of something the user: Knows (such as a password); Has (such as a mobile device or token); Is (such as biometrics); MFA for all users should be enabled, including non-privileged users who access sensitive data\n ii. Administrative Access: MFA should be enforced for all administrative access (e.g., access to cloud management consoles, virtual machines, remote access gateways, and other critical cloud infrastructure elements). If MFA cannot be implemented in a particular situation, the risk should be formally registered\n iii. Remote Access: MFA should be enforced for all remote access, whether through VPNs, web applications, or mobile devices\n iv. Third-Party Access: MFA should be enforced for third-party access, such as through APIs or cloud services, to protect against unauthorized access by external entities\n c.

Authentication Credentials Change Approval: Requests to change or modify authentication credentials (i.e., performing password resets, provisioning new tokens, generating new keys) should be approved only after verification of the user’s identity\n g. Continuous User Authentication (CUA): CUA should be leveraged as a method of maintaining user authentication throughout their session, requiring periodic reauthentication to ensure that the user is still authorized and has not been compromised\n h. Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO should be implemented for accessing multiple services and applications with a single login credential to simplify the authentication process for users\n i. Digital Certificates: Digital certificates should be utilized for authentication and authorization purposes, especially for system identities\n j. CRL and OCSP Checks: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) checks should be implemented to verify the validity and revocation status of digital certificates\n k. Certificate Lifecycle: The lifecycle of digital certificates should be securely managed including issuance, renewal, and revocation\n l. Certificate Storage: Digital certificates should be stored securely, using encryption and access control mechanisms\n m. Authentication Usage Monitoring:\n i. All authentication mechanisms and enabled features should be properly installed, configured, and authentication logs monitored for the desired and expected results\n ii.

The degree to which a CSP offers a service based on technology that is published or standardized typically will increase the interoperability across cloud systems. Interoperability and portability controls aim to prepare the CSC to protect their business from failure in case of a CSP outage. This can include plans for interoperability and portability with other CSPs or a different region with the current provider.\n \n IaaS Provider: \n The CSP should provide standardized hardware and computing resources that can interact with various disparate systems, with minimal effort, and which should strictly adhere to industry standards to maintain interoperability. The CSP should be able to support complex scenarios such as cloud brokerage, cloud bursting, hybrid clouds, multi-cloud federation, etc.\n \n The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures and standards that enable the CSC in deploying architecture that can involve multiple CSPs, hybrid models, or moving to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to the CSC. \n \n PaaS Provider: \n The CSP is responsible for providing a platform on which the CSC can build its systems.

The policies, processes, and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to the CSC.\n \n SaaS Provider: \n The CSP provides application capabilities over the cloud, and the CSC manages its administration and the information flowing in and out of the system. The end customer needs a browser and the majority of the administration at all the levels rests with the provider.\n \n The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures, and standards that support the CSC in retaining data and metadata in line with their data retention standards, and recovering all data and metadata when the service ceases or when moving to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes, and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to CSCs. \n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following: \n a. Standardized Communication Protocols: Ensure seamless interaction between different application interfaces by mandating the use of widely accepted communication protocols (e.g., RESTful APIs, JSON, XML).\n i.

Utilize cloud-neutral development frameworks and tools, such as serverless computing platforms or containerization technologies.\n ii. Employ cloud-agnostic programming languages and libraries.\n iii. Adopt standardized deployment processes and configuration management tools for cloud platforms.\n e. Common Data Processing Standards: Ensure that information processing adheres to industry-accepted standards by implementing processing logic based on well-established standards (e.g., SQL for databases, Apache Spark for big data processing).\n f. Cross-Platform Development Tools: Enable developers to create applications that can run on different platforms without significant modification by providing development tools and frameworks that support cross-platform development.\n g. Containerization Support: Simplify the deployment and execution of applications across various environments by supporting containerization technologies (e.g., Kubernetes) to encapsulate applications, making them portable and independent of underlying infrastructure.\n h. Infrastructure As Code (IaC) Practices: Standardize the description and provisioning of infrastructure to ensure consistency across environments by encouraging the use of IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to define and manage infrastructure configurations in a portable manner.\n i. Standardized Data Exchange Formats: Facilitate consistent and unambiguous data exchange between systems by defining and adhering to standardized data exchange formats and structures, ensuring compatibility and reducing data transformation complexities.\n j.

The data retention period should specify the length of time data will be stored, taking into account legal and regulatory requirements. Implement automated processes for data retention and deletion.\n iii. The scope of data retained should be defined and made available to the CSCs\n iv. A comprehensive data deletion policy for retained data should be defined to include secure deletion methods (refer to DCS-01 and DSP-02)\n m. Contract Termination: Upon contract termination, CSPs should provide reasonable assistance to CSCs in exporting and transferring their data to another cloud environment or on-premises systems. This assistance may include providing technical documentation, data export tools, and necessary support to facilitate seamless data migration.\n i. Outline CSCs' access to data upon contract termination in the contractual agreement\n ii. Implement secure methods for data handover or transfer to CSCs\n iii. Develop and document an exit plan that ensures a smooth transition of services and data to CSCs\n iv. Include security measures to protect data during the transition period\n v.

To avoid vendor lock-in, interoperability and portability should factor into the vendor selection process, continuous vendor audits, and exit planning. \n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Portability and interoperability combine to provide compatibility of cloud solutions. They are important considerations for cloud planning because together they ensure that cloud solutions continue to operate (through interoperability) and do so unchanged (through portability). When portability and interoperability between components is not addressed, unanticipated processing failures will likely result with associated costly disruption of business.\n \n Interoperability impacts often arise within cloud computing when changing business needs drive the need for changing a service provider. While a system may be functioning to specifications with one CSP, it may not with a new provider. Lack of insight can lead to being locked to one cloud service provider. Inevitable business decisions will result in changes over time that may lead to a change in provider (e.g., due to a need to migrate providers or platforms, desiring a different feature set, complete loss of the provider, or a legal dispute).\n \n The CSC should review the CSP's independent audit reports and documentation during the procurement process as well as throughout the period of contractual engagement. The CSC should ensure ongoing data risk assessments are carried out in support of interoperability and portability, and that internal policies and procedures are reviewed and updated to reflect any changes. \n \n IaaS Customer:\n Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:\n a. understand how virtual machine images can be captured and ported to new CSPs that may use different virtualization technologies, e.g., Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) or Open Virtualization format (OVF)\n b. identify and eliminate (or at least document) any provider-specific extensions to the virtual machine environment\n c. understand what practices are in place to make sure appropriate de-provisioning of VM images occurs after an application is ported from the CSP\n d. understand hardware- and platform-based dependencies that need to be identified before migration of the application/data\n e. identify options to resume or extend service with the legacy CSP in part or in whole if new service proves to be inferior\n f. determine if there are any management-level functions, interfaces, or APIs being used that are incompatible with or unimplemented by the new provider. \n \n PaaS Customer:\n Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:\n a. when possible, use platform components with a standard syntax, open APIs, and open standards, e.g., Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI)\n b. understand what tools are available for secure data transfer, backup, and restore\n c. understand and document application components and modules specific to the PaaS provider, and develop application architecture with layers of abstraction to minimize direct access to proprietary modules\n d. when migrating to a new platform, understand the impacts on performance and availability of the application, and how these impacts will be measured\n e. understand how application testing will be completed prior to and after migration, to verify that the services or applications are operating correctly. Ensure that both provider and user responsibilities for testing are well known and documented\n \n SaaS Customer:\n Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:\n a. assure the possibility of migration of backups and other copies of logs, access records, and any other pertinent information which may be required for legal and compliance reasons\n b. perform regular data extractions and backups to a format that is usable without the SaaS provider. Understand whether metadata can be preserved and migrated. If possible use data escrow services.\n c. store unstructured data in an established portable format such as the interoperable ZIP format for both reduced storage and transfer requirements. Aggregate files into ZIP archives to reduce complexities of moving sets of multiple files\n d. ensure the storage format selected interoperates regardless of the underlying platform. Data may need to be accessible from mobile, to desktop, to mainframe\n e. understand whether any custom tools being implemented will have to be redeveloped, or the new vendor can provide those tools\n f. understand management, monitoring, and reporting interfaces and their integration between environments\n g. assure there exists a provision for the new vendor to test and evaluate the applications before migration\n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following: \n a. ensure that the CSPs expose common and/or open interfaces to access all cloud functions in their cloud service offering\n b. ensure the ability to federate with different CSPs to enable higher levels of scalability\n c. plan to estimate costs involved for moving data to and from a CSP \n d. understand differences in security policy or controls, key management, and data protection between CSPs to avoid open undiscovered security gaps when moving to a new provider or platform\n e. assure security and privacy controls implementation effectiveness across old and new providers\n f. understand differences from a legal, regulatory, compliance, and operational perspective between CSPs. If the customer data and applications have strict compliance and privacy requirements, a new cloud vendor should be evaluated for those requirements before a decision to migrate is made\n g. understand how base services like monitoring, logging, and auditing would transfer over to a new vendor\n h. data integrity measures should be incorporated to ensure data remains unaltered while in the cloud (e.g., use watermarks, digital signing)\n i. use interoperable data compression for data moved to and from the cloud to reduce the volume of data being moved, and to reduce the time required to move\n j. use interoperable encryption such as that available through published specifications (e.g., OpenPGP, ZIP) that directly and persistently protect data and files regardless of the platform, storage systems, or location where it resides\n k. encrypt data before placing it in the cloud to avoid risks from multi-tenancy, or careless or disgruntled staff at the CSP\n l. understand who maintains access to data encryption keys, and retain control of all encryption keys as required by the encryption and key management policy"

This should be enforced by the use of secure protocols (TLS/HTTPS), secure APIs, perimeter security controls, and a CSP-provisioned security monitoring capability to identify potential attack vectors. The security architecture protecting the IaaS environment should be well documented, and follow a governed change management process. The configuration and associated documentation should be regularly reviewed at least annually, in order to identify any areas for improvement, or to adapt security policies to address new attack vectors. The CSP should also provide tools (either as part of the service or via a marketplace) to the CSC to enable them to build and design their own communications security architecture, however it is the responsibility of the CSC to deploy and manage the appropriate security controls.\n \n PaaS Provider:\n The CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications across the infrastructure and the platform that is being delivered as a service to the CSC. This includes the use of secure protocols (TLS/HTTPS) and secure APIs to support the CSC in accessing the platform service, along with perimeter security controls and a monitoring function to identify any potentially malicious activity from outside of the PaaS environment.

Identification and analysis of network traffic should be implemented, focusing on the paths of information data flows, including its origins, destinations, and routes through sensitive network areas\n ii. Network traffic monitoring and analysis tools should be implemented with capabilities for:\n • Packet capture and analysis\n • Flow monitoring\n • Anomaly detection and behavioral analytics\n • User activity tracking\n iii.

Network Communications Encryption: End-to-end encryption should be implemented to secure data in transit across the network communication channels\n i. Network devices should be configured to enforce strong encryption for specific protocols and ports\n ii. VPN tunnels should be utilized for secure communication between isolated network segments\n d. Network Communications Restriction:\n i. Access controls should be defined and enforced using firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), VPNs, and IAM systems\n ii. Firewalls should be deployed at key points within your cloud network architecture to act as gateways between internal and external network connections, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined security rules\n iii. Firewalls should be configured with granular access control rules, including IP address ranges, protocols, and ports\n iv. If the cloud environment requires publicly accessible services like web or email servers, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) should be established, acting as a buffer zone for isolating sensitive internal resources from potential external threats\n e. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): Adopt a zero-trust approach to cloud network access control, assuming that no user or network device is inherently trusted until verified to dynamically enforce access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and context\n f.

With regards to IaaS, there is a Shared and independent implementation responsibility between CSP and CSC for the Host and Guest OS hardening, since the CSP is responsible for the Host's hardening (OS and/or Hypervisor), and the CSC is responsible for the Guest VM and OS hardening. For PaaS and SaaS the implementation responsibility shifts to the CSP only, since the hardening of OS, hypervisor and underlying infrastructure are not part of CSC’s cloud stack and therefore the CSC has no control over their secure implementation. \n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n IaaS Provider: \n The CSP is responsible for provisioning hardware to support customer virtual machines that includes: hardening and maintaining updates to hypervisors, Host operating system, firmware, and utilizing confidential computing including trustworthiness assessment rooted in hardware, as well as Trusted Execution Environments,Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) and other trusted and assured equipment, obtained through a verified and reputable supplier. The CSP is not responsible for the updates to operating systems installed above the host infrastructure.\n \n PaaS Provider:\n The CSP is responsible for all system hardening host and guest OS patching across the infrastructure plane and it should do this as per the client’s requirements or as defined by good practice, but is not responsible for application level patching.\n \n SaaS Provider: \n The CSP is responsible for all elements of system patches, including application level requirements.\n \n Where the CSP is responsible for the updates to host (hypervisor)/guest and other system patching, it should deploy suitable testing methods before rolling out updates. Updates should be deployed in a suitable time frame depending on contractual agreements.\n \n Implementation best practices for cloud platforms hardening include (but are not limited to):\n a. Host/Guest OS, Hypervisor, VMs, Control Plane Hardening:\n i. A secure configuration baseline using industry vendors and benchmarks should be created and utilized to ensure consistency across all platforms\n ii. A minimal installation should be utilized and implemented, using pre-configured secure templates according to the baseline and having only essential system services/processes enabled (i.e., unnecessary ports, protocols, and network services should be disabled or removed to reduce the attack surface)\n iii. Software (OSes, Hypervisor, VMs and applications) should be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches\n iv. Strong authentication (e.g., complex passwords, MFA) should be configured for accessing the hypervisor/VM/OS management interfaces\n v. Security features such as firewalls, anti-malware, and system logging should be enabled\n vi. Configurations should be regularly reviewed and updated against the configuration baseline to ensure only necessary features are enabled\n vii. For sensitive CSC workloads:\n • A dedicated, single-tenant or bare-metal hypervisor instances should be used to avoid the exploitation of possible hypervisor vulnerabilities\n • Conventional virtual machines (VMs) should be replaced with confidential VMs for enhanced security\n • Secure boot and virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) should be utilized for enhanced security\n • Hypervisors/OSes/VMs that have been rigorously tested for security should be selected (i.e., evaluated against Common Criteria (CC) Protection Profiles (PP) and assigned an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL))\n \n VM Lifecycle-Specific Implementation Guidelines.\n a. Creation\n i. Secure VM templates should be used that are pre-configured with security settings, including hardened OS configurations, patching schedules, and access controls\n ii. VM images should be scanned for vulnerabilities before provisioning them to CSCs\n iii. Unnecessary applications, services, and drivers should be removed from VM images to reduce the attack surface\n iv. A detailed inventory of all VMs should be maintained to track their creation, deployment, and status\n v. Compliance checks should be implemented to ensure VMs meet security and regulatory requirements\n b. Deployment\n i. Provisioning controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized deployment of VMs\n ii. Network segmentation should be used to isolate VMs from each other and the rest of the network.\n iii. Access controls should be implemented to restrict identities access to VMs based on the cloud IAM access control policy\n iv. Monitoring and alerting systems should be implemented and configured to detect suspicious activity and potential security breaches\n v. Change management process should be implemented to control and track changes made to VMs (refer to CCC domain)\n c. Operation\n i. Security patches and updates should be regularly applied to VMs to address vulnerabilities and prevent known exploits\n ii. Vulnerability scans should be regularly conducted to identify and remediate security weaknesses\n iii. Configuration management tools should be used to enforce consistent and secure configurations for VMs\n iv. VMs should be continuously monitored for resource usage, security events, and potential anomalies\n v. Logging and auditing of VM activity should be enabled to track changes and events.\n d. Maintenance\n i. Backup and recovery strategies should be implemented to protect VM data from loss or corruption\n ii. Maintenance tasks on VMs should adhere to the change management process\n iii. Any changes made to VMs should be tested and validated before deploying them to production\n iv. Documentation of VM configurations, maintenance procedures, and security policies should be maintained\n e. Decommissioning\n i. VM disks should be encrypted before decommissioning to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access\n ii. VM disks should be securely destroyed or erased to prevent data recovery\n iii. Decommissioned VMs should be removed from the inventory and tracking systems and the decommissioning process documented to ensure proper authorization\n iv. Audit trails should be maintained to record the decommissioning activity and data destruction procedures\n \n Container-Specific Implementation Guidelines.\n Technical controls should aid situations when only the ports, protocols, and services necessary to meet business needs are provided. Such controls should be based on common benchmarks.\n \n The CSP should implement anti-malware, file integrity monitoring, and logging, and utilize hardware rooted trust in confidential computing (CC) and virtual trusted platform modules (vTPMs).\n \n Whenever possible, organizations should use minimalistic, container-specific host operating systems with all other services and functionality disabled, and with read-only file systems and other hardening practices employed to reduce attack surfaces.\n \n The following best practices for securing containers are also recommended:\n a. Dedicated Container Host: hosts that run containers should only run containers and not other apps—such as web servers or databases—outside of containers\n b. Container Host Patch Management: Hosts that run containers should be continuously scanned for vulnerabilities and updated promptly\n c. Hardened Container Host: The host OS should not run unnecessary system services\n d. Container Host Access: Access to the container host should be based on the need-to-know and least privilege principles\n e. Container Security Monitoring: file integrity monitoring and host intrusion detection should be leveraged for containers.\n f.

It is a standard best practice to separate production and non-production environments to ensure a stable production environment that is not influenced by changes in the non-production environment, and to ensure that test data never enters into a production environment (and equally that no production data enters the non-production environment). This applies equally for both CSP and CSC whether the service being delivered is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n The CSP should maintain a non-production environment that is completely separate from the production environment in order to safeguard production systems from potential threats in non-production environments. The non-production environment should be running in an architecturally similar environment which is both logically and physically separated from the production environment through the use of appropriate security controls. \n \n The non-production environment should be used for testing any pre-production releases, and should be exclusively used with test data instead of actual CSC/business data.\n \n Implementation best practices for CSPs include (but are not limited to):\n a. Accounts and Access Permissions Separation:\n i. Distinct IAM policies should exist and implemented for each environment, strictly defining access control rules and authorization levels\n ii. Access permissions should be granted based on the specific roles and tasks associated with each environment to ensure that the necessary least privileges are provided\n iii. Distinct accounts for accessing and managing production and non-production environments should be created\n b. Network Logical/Physical Separation:\n i. Logical separation between production and non-production environments should be implemented (e.g., using Virtual networks (VNet), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and cloud Network Security Groups (NSGs))\n ii. Each environment should have its own VNet, encapsulated within its own network security group (NSG) to prevent accidental or deliberate cross-environment communication\n iii. Physical separation should also be considered (e.g., using separate data centers, racks, or even different physical locations)\n iv. Network segmentation tools should be utilized to isolate production and non-production environments from each other (e.g., separate subnets, firewalls, and access control lists (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized traffic from traversing between the environments)\n c. Sandbox Environments for Development and Testing:\n i. Sandbox environments specifically designed for development and testing purposes should be created\n ii. Sandboxes should be isolated from production systems to prevent accidental or malicious code deployments from affecting critical data and systems\n iii. Automated testing procedures should be implemented to validate the functionality and security of non-production environments before deployment to production\n d. Resource Management Separation: \n i. Separate resource management tools should be implemented for each environment to prevent accidental provisioning, configuration changes, or deletions in the wrong environment\n ii. Data separation strategies should be implemented to prevent the accidental mixing of production and non-production data (e.g., use different storage solutions, data masking techniques, or implementing data segregation rules within data repositories)\n iii. Different versioning systems should be used for production and non-production environments to avoid conflicts between releases and ensure that only tested and approved changes are deployed to production\n iv. Different naming conventions should be adopted for resources in production and non-production environments to avoid confusion and accidental changes to the wrong environment\n e. Documentation: Documentation outlining the separation policies, access controls, network configurations, and testing procedures should be developed and maintained for each of production and non-production environments\n f. Updates Management: Patches and updates should be first applied in the non-production environment and after successful testing, then applied to the production environment\n g. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuous monitoring and evaluation of both production and non-production environments should be implemented to ensure that are adequately secured and aligned with security standards (e.g., Monitor System logs, network traffic, vulnerability scanning, and user activity to detect suspicious behavior or potential security breaches)",

The IR plans should clearly define roles and responsibilities and any shared responsibilities with the use of KSSRIs or KSCSRIs where possible.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n The IR plan relates back to the SEF-01 implementation guidelines to ensure that corresponding policy and procedure requirements are incorporated for all phases of the IR life cycle.\n \n The IR plan should provide a methodology that enables efficient management of security incidents for the organization’s cloud products and services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and clearly defines the relied-upon CSP’s services to achieve a coordinated response. Once the IR plan is established and documented the plan needs to be approved and communicated.\n \n The IR plan should include the following provisions:\n a. Scope: The IR plan should apply to both internal dependencies (such as IT, operations, support, and legal) and external dependencies (suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, and other third parties). The cloud services, systems, applications, users, and data that are in scope and monitored for events and incidents. Ensure the scope network and infrastructure is monitored by the CSP\n b. Incident Response Team and Stakeholders: The stakeholders include customers, law enforcement who receive information about incidents and/or can be involved in incident management\n c. Incident Tracking and Classification: Define the issue and tracking system used for recording the incident. Classify incidents by severity and urgency (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Major vs Minor), using threat intelligence, attack vector taxonomy Mitre ATT&CK for PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS tactics and techniques, and data classification for any data involved, the scope, and the impact of the incident.\n d. Response Type and Expected Response Timeframes: The plan should indicate when a manual vs. automated response is required by the CSP or CSC, the time frames to respond by (e.g., mean time to acknowledge aka MTTA), by when the CSP or CSC is required to report an incident, who is responsible for containment of the incident, and the average expected mean time to containment (MTTC). The response may invoke subsequent IR plans such as an encryption key compromise-recovery plan for restoring cryptographic security services\n e. Evidence Gathering and Handling: Steps to collect and maintain the integrity of the evidence should be provided, when and where to make copies, when to use exact replicas for analysis, the CSP’s or CSC’s responsibilities around logs, other collected evidence, storing in restricted read-only repositories, using a separate account or another CSP, hashing procedures, and chain of custody for ensuring admissibility in legal proceedings\n f. Incident Lifecycle Phases and Procedures: Procedures for preparation, detection and analysis, eradication and recovery, post-mortem with continuous analysis at each phase to determine effectiveness, the CSC’s preventative measures such as IDS/IPS, and provide specificity around incidents with shared responsibilities.\n g. Roles and Responsibilities: Common shared security responsibilities between the CSP and CSC in relation to incident response:\n i. Client and endpoint incidents – (SaaS) shared CSC and CSP\n ii. Identity and access incidents – (PaaS, SaaS) shared CSC and CSP\n iii. Application Incidents – (PaaS) shared CSC and CSP\n iv. Network incidents – (IaaS) shared CSC and CSP\n v.

Network incidents (PaaS, SaaS) – CSP\n xii. Host incidents (PaaS, SaaS) - CSP\n xiii. Infrastructure incidents (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) - CSP\n h. Notification and Reporting: List of personnel at the CSP and CSC, third-party personnel, and distribution lists for notification. Use internal and external websites or portals where incidents and service outage information can be published and updated regularly to advise on the status of incidents that affect major services. US-CERT (required for US federal agencies and systems operated on behalf of the federal government) serves as the federal incident response center\n i. Business Impact Assessment Information: The CSP and CSC should have BIA information for each asset, system, application, and associated classified data, with owners identified and the relevant internal departments, upstream/downstream interdependencies, services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and other business-critical relationships (such as supply chain) that may be impacted\n j. Reference Information: Information on how to determine the applicable RPO, RTO, and MTD of a particular system or set of systems for restore from backup recovery procedures to restore affected services, logs, and data as per agreements between the CSC and CSP to maintain business continuity. Outline the criteria required to select the appropriate eradication and recovery choice, e.g., restore, rebuild, replace, redirect or remove.\n k. Schedule: A schedule to review, test, evaluate, and maintain and approve the plan. Define the frequency or schedule to conduct the review, test coordination, and approve the plan. \n l. Plan Testing: Conduct a paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation where feasible with the participation of both the CSP and CSC as defined in the schedule. Evaluate and maintain/update the plan accordingly:\n i. after testing the plan and with lessons learned obtained\n ii. after incidents that resulted in changes to the response methodology, e.g., new attack vectors, containment strategies, false positives, false negatives, or caused a deviation from the response plan, and exposures detected from penetration testing.\n iii. Timing: When services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), critical assets, applications, and classified data are either added or removed\n iv. Plan Reapproval: The plan should be reapproved after all necessary changes are made\n v. Change Control: The IR plan should maintain a document control section indicating when the plan was tested and the changes to the plan content with each iteration",

Triage is used for identifying, evaluating, prioritizing and responding to security events (and potential incidents) that impact both parties. The CSP can provide valuable insights into potential sources or root causes of the security event, while the CSC can contribute information specific to their data, configuration, applications, and user activity. This joint effort helps to identify the event’s scope and potential impact, leading to a more targeted and efficient response. \n \n For example, a security incident occurring in the platform layer for an IaaS infrastructure should be driven jointly by the CSC and the CSP to determine if it originated in the CSC’s environment or the CSP’s environment.\n This may involve containment measures implemented by the CSP, such as isolating affected resources, while the CSC can take steps like user account suspension or data recovery, depending on the specific event.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n A fully documented and annually reviewed and approved triage management process should be in operation to ensure that all security events are investigated and evaluated in a timely manner.\n \n The CSP should perform a triage process for all supporting infrastructure — virtual elastic compute, server operating systems, storage, and networking — but also middleware, development tools, BI services, database management systems, and applications configured for use by the CSC.

The CSC and CSP jointly engage in implementing, managing, and monitoring the cloud services. The various controls (e.g., from the CCM) should be performed by one party or the other, by both parties independently, or by both parties in a dependent manner. \n \n The SSRM serves as the key mechanism to:\n a. comprehensively elaborate the controls necessary to implement, use, manage, and monitor the cloud services in a secure manner\n b. establish and document a common agreement between the CSP and CSC about their respective responsibilities and expectations regarding the controls\n c. serve as the basis for contractual service agreement and ongoing contractual management and compliance \n d. support effective ongoing control execution, management, monitoring, and assessment activities\n e. facilitate rapid and effective IR and management through clear delineation of responsibilities and communication protocols\n f. foster transparency regarding responsibilities and relationship expectations\n \n Other parties engaged by the CSP or CSC may also be involved in supporting the delivery of cloud services. For example, a SaaS service provided by one CSP may involve the use of another CSP to provide underlying IaaS services. The security responsibilities of any supporting service providers in the supply chain should also be reflected in the SSRM.\n \n Given the SSRM's critical role in supporting effective cloud security practices, the CSC and CSP should establish and maintain policies and procedures for the application of the SSRM across their respective cloud services. This ensures consistency and adequate coverage across all services. \n \n The specific SSRM policies and procedures needed for the CSP or CSC may be influenced by a number of factors. They should align with and augment broader organizational policies and procedures for procurement and contract management, third-party risk management, and cybersecurity risk management to adequately address the unique considerations and risks of cloud services. \n \n Further, the rigor and comprehensiveness of an organization's SSRM policies and procedures should be commensurate with the risks, complexity, and criticality of the cloud services it uses or provides. For example, the SSRM policies and procedures of a CSC that uses a few non-critical SaaS services do not need to be as extensive and rigorous as a CSC whose business fundamentally relies on extensive IaaS. Additionally, the CSC’s expectations for security program management will drive the scope and rigor of the SSRM policies and procedures.\n \n The CSP’s policies and procedures should recognize and take into consideration the many CSP- and CSC-specific circumstances that may arise in their cloud service implementations. In particular, exceptions to policies and procedures should be formally managed and approved at the appropriate level of management. This guidance is particularly relevant to contractual commitments between the parties that engender potentially more risk to the CSP or CSC (e.g., compromises a small organization may need to make due to lack of negotiating leverage). \n \n The SSRM policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with the evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks. Updates should consider and incorporate lessons learned from the CSP's own cloud service implementations, as well as current industry standards and guidance (e.g., current CCM versions and implementation guidelines). Additionally, if a significantly large, complex, and/or business-critical cloud services implementation is contemplated, the CSP may first want to review existing SSRM policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the anticipated risks and complexity.\n \n The need to implement and maintain SSRM policies and procedures is the same for all cloud service models, however there may be differences in the specific procedures needed for different cloud service models or for specialized cloud services obtained (e.g., IDaaS). For example, the SSRM procedures employed to manage an IaaS implementation may be more extensive than for a SaaS implementation given the greater responsibilities placed on the CSC under the IaaS model.\n \n Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\n a. organizational SSRM risk management objectives\n b. integration and alignment of SSRM policy and procedures with procurement, legal, third-party risk management, and cyber risk management policies and procedures\n c. how the SSRM is integrated and aligned with service contracts\n d. roles and responsibilities for SSRM implementation across the cloud implementation lifecycle (i.e., in due diligence, contracting, implementation, management and monitoring, and service termination)\n e. definition of risk levels applicable to the extent and rigor of due diligence, management, and monitoring activities and procedures\n f. how the SSRM is reviewed, validated, and maintained in collaboration with the CSP over the lifecycle of a cloud service implementation (e.g., by different risk levels)\n g. how exceptions to SSRM policy and/or issues and exceptions with respect to the allocation or performance of responsibilities are identified and managed\n h. reporting requirements for SSRM program activities and performance\n i. approval levels required for SSRM-related decisions",

Such documentation should address, in particular, any necessary coordination between the third party, the CSC, and the CSP.\n \n For those controls that are “Shared (Dependent),” the CSP should collaborate with the CSC to ensure that each party's responsibilities are fully documented and consistent with the delineation of responsibilities developed under STA-04.\n \n SSRM documentation should also address or reference service level expectations, workload management, contact, escalation, supporting tools, reporting, or other information that may be necessary or helpful in managing the CSC's and CSP's respective responsibilities.\n \n To ensure adequate coverage, all CCM controls should be addressed in the SSRM, even if specifically noted to be not applicable. Further, the delineation of responsibilities in the SSRM should be consistent with any contractual terms agreed to by the parties under STA-09, or may be incorporated directly or by reference in the contract. The CSC and CSP may defer documenting certain details of the SSRM until after the contract is executed or the service is implemented, however, the SSRM should always remain consistent with the contractual agreement. \n \n SSRM Implementation and Management. \n Once agreed to by the CSP and CSC, the SSRM for a given cloud service implementation guides many aspects of the ongoing relationship. \n \n Each party is responsible for implementing, managing, monitoring, and auditing their respective responsibilities for each CCM control as delineated in the SSRM (see STA-06). If questions or issues arise regarding control responsibility, the SSRM and contract agreement should be consulted to address and resolve any ambiguities. The CSP and CSC should review their supply chain agreement, and the associated SSRM for the services, at least annually (see STA-10). The SSRM should be updated as necessary to address any changes or clarifications in the shared security responsibilities. If an SSRM requires an update, the CSP should determine if the update is specific to a given CSC implementation, or if the SSRM for the service offering at large should be updated (see STA-03).\n \n The CSP may choose to implement automated tools or reporting to facilitate the ongoing monitoring and management of the SSRM or the underlying service's controls.\n \n The need for the CSP and CSC to document, implement, and maintain the SSRM for a cloud service implementation remains the same for all cloud service models. However, the specifics of each SSRM could change from implementation to implementation.",

Third-party Endpoint Security Tools: The installation and configuration of endpoint security software (antivirus, endpoint detection and response) should be enforced on all authorized third-party devices\n d. Third-party Endpoint Secure Channels: Ensure secure communication channels (e.g., VPN) for all data transfer between third-party endpoints and organizational assets\n e. Third-party Endpoint Agreements: Written agreements (contracts) should be established and maintained between CSP and third-parties, including an acknowledgment that the third party is responsible for the security of the data they store, process, or transmit on the CSP’s behalf. Agreements should include requirements to address the information security risks associated with third-party endpoint access, including guidelines for authentication, authorization, data encryption, and device management. These requirements are subsequently applicable to relevant nth-party subcontractors throughout the supply chain\n f. Third-party Agreements Provisions: formal contracts that specify, at a minimum:\n i. A joint risk assessment with the CSC to identify potential vulnerabilities associated with third-party endpoints accessing organizational cloud assets\n ii. The covered information’s confidential nature and value\n iii. The types of devices and operating systems supported for secure access\n iv. The security measures to be implemented and/or complied with as required by applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance, and third-party endpoints access limitations\n v. Responsibilities for patching and updating third-party endpoint software\n vi. The service levels to be achieved in the services provided\n vii. The format and frequency of reporting to the CSP’s information security management forum\n viii. The arrangement for representation of the third party in appropriate organizational meetings and working groups\n ix. The arrangements for Third-party security assessments to ensure compliance with contractual agreements and regulatory requirements (refer to STA)\n x. The penalties exacted if any of the preceding specifications fail\n g. Third-party Endpoints Responsible: The Third Party should designate a specific individual or role (e.g., within contract or supply chain function) responsible for managing access privileges granted to its personnel who require access to the CSP systems and data (e.g., personnel access changes, access privileges, credentials management by third-party personnel)\n h. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Logs related to third-party endpoint access should be continuously monitored for suspicious activity",
