Scope and Objectives: A definition and scope of endpoints and the acceptable-use policy objectives and requirements for all endpoints (mobile devices, virtual, desktop, etc.)\n \n Note: physical and virtual servers, containers, and similar endpoints are addressed in the DCS and IVS domains, while application and interface endpoints are discussed in the AIS domain\n \n b. Application and Service Approval: A list of approved cloud services and applications that personnel are permitted to use on their endpoints should be maintained. The list should be regularly reviewed and updated (incl. approved systems, servers, applications, application stores, application extensions, and plugins)\n c. Endpoints Compatibility: Minimum OS requirements for endpoints to ensure compatibility with essential applications and security tools should be established. An compatibility matrix for approved applications should be maintained to ensure they function properly on the supported operating systems\n d. Endpoint Inventory: A maintained inventory of all endpoints connected to the organization's network, including laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile phones, IoT devices, servers, and virtual environments (should include device details, ownership information, security status, and software configurations)\n \n Note: each endpoint device should be assigned to a named person who is responsible for it. Such devices may be shared (e.g., in shared work areas), but a single individual should still be assigned responsibility for it. Non-device endpoints should also have owners responsible for assessing risks and ensuring appropriate controls.\n \n e. Endpoint Management: Granular access control mechanisms to restrict endpoint access to authorized systems and resources. Data access limitations should be enforced to prevent unauthorized data storage, transmission, or processing on endpoints\n f. Endpoint Operating System: A change management process for endpoint operating systems to control and review changes to configurations, software installations, patches and updates\n g. Storage Encryption: Whole-disk encryption should be utilized on all endpoints to protect sensitive data at rest\n h. Anti-Malware Detection and Prevention: Real-time anti-malware software deployment on all endpoints and regular scans scheduling to detect and prevent malicious software infections\n i. Software Firewall: Software firewalls should be configured on all endpoints to control inbound and outbound network traffic\n j. Data Loss Prevention: DLP technologies should be configured to monitor and control the movement of sensitive data from endpoints. Enforce data access restrictions and prevent unauthorized data transfer to external devices or cloud services\n k. Remote Locate: Remote geo-location capabilities enabled on mobile devices to track their location in case of loss or theft\n l. Remote Wipe: Remote wipe capabilities enabled on all endpoints to remotely delete company data in case of loss or theft. Requirements related to non-company data loss if a full or partial wipe of a device is required should be defined\n m. Third-Party Endpoint Security Posture: Security requirements, responsibilities, and obligations related to third-party endpoint access in contractual agreements and SLAs\n n. Privacy: Requirements regarding privacy expectations for remote location identification, litigation, e-discovery, and legal holds (especially for personally-owned devices) should be defined\n o. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite\n i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures\n ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained\n p. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders\n q. Maintenance and Reviews: Endpoint security policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with the evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks",
