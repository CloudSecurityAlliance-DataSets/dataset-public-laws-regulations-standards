"Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management",Encryption and Key Management Policy and Procedures,CEK-01,"Establish, document, approve, communicate, apply, evaluate and maintain
policies and procedures for Cryptography, Encryption and Key Management. Review
and update the policies and procedures at least annually.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a ""Shared (Independent)"" responsibility between the CSP and the CSC as the creation of a Cryptography, Encryption and Key Management policy by each party is essential for effective security. The CSP should offer cryptography services, and in such a case it is responsible for the infrastructure that supports these services. The CSC, on the other hand, is responsible for correctly using these services to secure their data, for instance, choosing when and what data to encrypt, and managing access to encryption keys.

Implementation Guidelines.
The CSP should have a robust system for cryptographic management with clear policies and procedures for encryption and key management, including key generation, distribution, rotation, revocation, destruction, activation, suspension, deactivation, archival, compromise, recovery, inventory management, purposes, and access. These policies should be reviewed and updated at least annually.

IaaS Provider:
Policies and procedures should be in place that dictate how and when these encryption methods are to be used, who has access to the keys, how the lifecycle of these keys is managed, roles and responsibilities, data protection, change management, risk management, monitoring, reporting, incident handling, and audit. An IaaS provider should offer mechanisms for encryption both in transit and at rest for all data, along with a key management service. The CSP should ensure that these services comply with the latest security standards and best practices.

PaaS Provider:
Policies and procedures should be in place to guide the usage and management of these encryption methods and keys, including change management and risk management practices. A PaaS provider should offer platform-level encryption for data at rest and in transit, including a secure key management system. The CSP should adhere to security best practices and standards, including data protection protocols like data encryption and algorithm selection.

SaaS Provider:
Policies and procedures should be in place that dictate how encryption is handled at the application level, including key management, again featuring the full spectrum of key management activities. The provider should ensure all data at rest and in transit is encrypted using approved cryptographic protection methods. The CSP should offer the CSC the ability to manage their own keys where feasible and monitor the technology closely to keep up with emergence of threats and vulnerabilities. The CSP should ensure incident handling procedures, audit mechanisms, and activity logging for encryption and key management processes.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives:
i. Scope definition and governance of the organization's use of cryptography, encryption, and key management practices to protect sensitive data
ii. Objectives for the secure implementation of cryptographic controls for data security and the establishment of key management practices to safeguard encryption keys from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure
b. Roles and Responsibilities: Responsibilities of all entities involved in managing cryptographic controls and the encryption key lifecycle. This includes responsibilities for generating, distributing, storing, rotating, and disposing of keys
c. Encryption Standards: Cryptographic data security and protection requirements, for both data in transit and at rest and covering the necessary encryption standards, algorithms and best practices
d. Cryptography Change Management: Procedures for making changes to cryptographic controls and encryption key management, including who can authorize changes, how changes should be documented, and processes for testing and auditing changes
e. Risk Management: Procedures for identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks associated with cryptographic controls and key management that should be integrated into the CSP's broader risk management framework
f. Key Management Activities: Requirements regarding key management activities, including key generation, distribution, rotation, revocation, destruction, activation, suspension, deactivation, archival, compromise, recovery, inventory management, purposes, and access
g. Monitoring and Reporting: Monitoring of cryptographic controls and key management practices, along with regular reporting of their status, including any anomalies or potential breaches to the CSC
h. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite
i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures
ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained
i. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders
j. Maintenance and Reviews: Cryptography, Encryption, and Key Management policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale already provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Customer: 
The CSC should consider including in policy provisions for managing the encryption of their data within the infrastructure provided by the CSP.  The CSC should use the tools and resources provided by the CSP for key management, following best practices.

PaaS Customer: 
The CSC should create a policy that ensures how they use the secure platform provided by the CSP effectively, including using the encryption provided at the platform level. The CSC policy  includes additional encryption within the platform, depending on CSC's needs and the services provided by the CSP. 

SaaS Customer: 
The CSC should create a policy that ensures how they use the secure software service provided by the CSP effectively, including using the encryption provided at the software level. The CSC should work with the CSP to understand how keys are managed within the software service and ensure it meets their needs and compliance requirements. 

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
The policies provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Review cryptography, encryption, and key management policy and procedures and confirm that these have been approved by appropriate management.
2. Confirm that the policy and procedures are reviewed at least annually.
"
"Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management",CEK Roles and Responsibilities,CEK-02,"Define and implement cryptographic, encryption and key management
roles and responsibilities.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a ""Shared (Independent)"" responsibility between the CSP and CSC, because the CSP is responsible for defining and implementing roles and responsibilities for cryptographic operations and key management inside their organization. In order to correspond with the CSC's individual security demands, the CSP is expected to provide configurable options related to these duties. However, the CSP has no control over how the CSC manages the options presented, making the role 'independent'. Depending on the tools and features provided, the CSP might influence the CSC's roles and responsibilities, in particular with service models such as SaaS.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Provider:
a. define and enforce roles and responsibilities around key managers, ensuring they cannot access protected data or the cryptographic engine. Also, provide the CSC with robust access controls and role definition capabilities within their platform. This includes enabling the CSC to implement the principles of SoD and split knowledge
b. incorporate practices like SoD, splitting knowledge, and least privilege access to cryptographic resources and processes
c. establish clear policies for the management of both operational and backed-up key information storage and recovery. Assist customers in defining cryptoperiods, overseeing key and digital certificate inventories, and verifying the integrity of stored key information prior to use. Manage the process of revoking compromised keys and creating replacement keys or digital certificates. Maintain transparency throughout these processes
d. offer secure solutions for key storage and management, including secure distribution of private and secret keys and the metadata, and provide customers with the ability to securely generate, revoke, and destroy their cryptographic keys

PaaS Provider:
a. define roles and responsibilities for the key management system, including a policy authority responsible for all operational CKMS roles, and reports to IT executives
b. manage the encryption and key management at the platform level, securing the runtime environment to prevent unauthorized access to cryptographic keys and protecting keys in use
c. ensure that policies are in place for storage and recovery of archived key information and integrity checks of stored key information.
d. offer encryption solutions at the data, application, and transaction layers, and support the CSC in implementing their own encryption solutions if required

SaaS Provider:

b. implement robust encryption and key management practices for the CSC data at rest, in transit, and in use, providing it with transparency about these practices
c. offer options for the CSC to manage its own encryption keys where possible (e.g., bring-your-own-key-scenarios, aka BYOK), and support the CSC in the secure implementation of these options
d. establish the rules for the management of the storage and recovery of operational and backed-up key information.

Applicable to all service models:
a. define and follow key lifecycle responsibilities, including key generation, distribution, cryptoperiod establishment, key revocation, storage and recovery, integrity checks, and destruction of keys when they are no longer required
b. conduct regular audits and reviews to ensure compliance and check the effectiveness of segregation of duties, roles, and responsibilities
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership for the CSC is also ""Shared (Independent""). This results from the CSC's need to identify and implement roles and responsibilities to appropriately utilize and manage the CSP's cryptographic operations and key management options. While the CSP provides the essential tools and options, it is the responsibility of the CSC to develop roles and operational procedures that are appropriate for its specific needs and operational context. In certain service models, such as SaaS, the CSC's role may be shaped by the CSP's options and tools, but the primary responsibility for defining and implementing roles and responsibilities remains with the CSC.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Customer:
a. establish clearly defined roles and responsibilities for cryptographic key management within its systems. This includes duties like managing its own keys at the virtual machine and application levels if using CMKs
b. define duties to effectively leverage the access controls and role definition capabilities provided by the CSP, aiming for proper implementation of SoD and split knowledge principles
c. define responsibilities for secure cryptographic key operations - generation, distribution, revocation, and destruction
d. define tasks to engage with the CSP for secure distribution of keys, effective inventory management of keys and digital certificates, and establishing mechanisms to revoke and replace compromised keys
e. if using CMKs, define responsibilities like generating, rotating, and managing its own keys at the virtual machine and application levels
f. perform regular integrity checks of stored key information

PaaS Customer:
a. establish roles and responsibilities for encryption and key management at the application level
b. assign responsibilities to leverage CSP-provided solutions and to implement additional security measures as required to protect keys in use. This may include using Hardware Security Module (HSM), KMS, secret management, or secure methods for key storage and usage
c. define responsibility to use the provided logging and monitoring capabilities by the CSP to promptly detect and respond to any key compromise incidents
d. define responsibility to engage with the CSP to understand platform-level security measures and ensure that its application-level encryption and key management requirements are met
e. if using CMKs, define the responsibilities like generating, rotating, and managing its own keys at the application levels

SaaS Customer:
a. ensure understanding and agreement with the CSP's encryption and key management practices for customer data at rest, in transit, and in use
b. if the option is available, consider the role of managing its own encryption keys (e.g., BYOK). This includes generating, rotating, and managing its own keys for use with the SaaS application
c. delegate the duty of validating that the CSP has clearly defined and separated key management roles to prevent unauthorized access or changes to keys

Applicable to all service models:
a. define and follow key lifecycle responsibilities, including key generation, distribution, cryptoperiod establishment, key revocation, storage and recovery, integrity checks, and destruction of keys when they are no longer required
b. conduct regular audits and reviews to ensure compliance and check the effectiveness of segregation of duties, roles, and responsibilities
","1. Obtain cryptographic, encryption policy, and key management procedures.
2. Verify, by interviews or otherwise, that employees and stakeholders are aware of their roles and responsibilities, and obtain supporting documentation evidencing that the responsibilities are being managed in-line with policy and procedures.
"
"Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management",Data Encryption,CEK-03,"Provide cryptographic protection to data at-rest and in-transit,
using cryptographic libraries certified to approved standards.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
In the context of the service delivery models, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, the CSP has the primary responsibility of managing and providing cryptographic protection for data at rest and in transit, using certified cryptographic libraries, but the control's implementation is also dependent on the CSC, making it a shared but dependent responsibility. 

Implementation Guidelines.
This measure enhances the security posture by safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access during storage and transmission. Using cryptographic libraries certified to approved standards adds an extra layer of assurance, meeting industry benchmarks for encryption, and instilling confidence in both the CSP and CSCs regarding the confidentiality and integrity of their data.

IaaS Provider:
a. CSP should maintain a secure CKMS that meets or exceeds FIPS validation or approval by other relevant international standardization bodies
b. offer mechanisms for full disk encryption options for at-rest databases and file servers and encryption for in-transit (network) data, providing the CSC the ability to implement as needed
c. provide secure network communication protocols, such as TLS, to protect in-transit data between virtual machines, CSP services and users 
d. maintain security of the underlying infrastructure supporting these cryptographic services
e. offer mechanisms for keeping data encryption keys in a protected environment, safe from exfiltration and tampering, including tampering by the CSP

PaaS Provider:
a. In addition to the responsibilities listed for IaaS, the CSP should offer platform-level encryption options for at-rest, in use and in-transit data. This should include options to encrypt various data structures/types (e.g., files, records, or fields) 
b. offer the CSC the ability to manage its encryption settings, including the selection of encryption algorithms where appropriate 

SaaS Provider: 
a. beyond the responsibilities listed for IaaS and PaaS, ensure that customer data is encrypted both at rest and in transit 
b. ensure that end user workstations and interfaces are secured using encryption for at-rest and in-transit data
c. offer options for end-to-end encryption, where data remains encrypted from the point of origin to the point of use 
d. offer options for end-to-end encryption, like trusted execution environments, where the data remains encrypted while in-use
e. manage encryption keys securely, ensuring they are regularly rotated and not exposed to unauthorized parties. Also, the CSP should provide secure methods for the CSC to manage encryption keys within the software service, including generation, rotation, and revocation of keys
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership for the encryption of both at-rest and in-transit data is shared with a dependency between the CSP and CSC. While the CSP provides the cryptographic tools and libraries, the CSC is responsible for correctly implementing and using these tools to ensure the appropriate level of data protection.

Implementation Guidelines.
From the CSC perspective, the cryptographic protection of data at-rest and in-transit using certified libraries ensures the confidentiality and integrity of their sensitive information within the cloud environment. This control provides reassurance to CSCs in the security measures implemented by the CSP and safeguarding their data against potential security threats.

IaaS Customer: 
a. ensure that data in storage & in transit, use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for data in use, including databases and files, are encrypted. This may involve selecting the appropriate level of encryption, enabling full disk encryption, encrypting specific data structures, using encryption for sensitive data, and managing encryption keys
b. ensure that in transit data is encrypted, including across system interfaces, public networks, and electronic messaging (e.g., email, video, voice). Secure network communication protocols, such as TLS, with strong industry accepted ciphers
c. manage encryption keys securely, including their secure generation, distribution, rotation, revocation, and destruction
d. Mechanisms should be utilized for keeping data encryption keys in a protected environment, like trusted execution environments, safe from exfiltration and tampering, including by the CSP staff

c. leverage the provided APIs or SDKs to implement encryption within applications 

SaaS  Customer: 
a. identify and classify its data to determine what needs to be encrypted 
b. ensure that encryption is enabled and properly configured for both at-rest and in transit data. As per business requirement, this can include end-to-end encryption where appropriate. The CKMS service can be utilized for efficient management 
c. if the CSP allows for CSC-managed keys, ensure to implement secure key management practices. This includes secure key generation, rotation, and revocation
","1. Identify data flows within the organization that are in-transit.
2. Identify data storages within the organization that are at-rest.
3. Confirm that the identified data flows and data storages have been protected by an appropriate cryptographic algorithm aligned to cryptography, encryption, and key management policy and procedures.
"
"Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management",Encryption Algorithm,CEK-04,"Use encryption algorithms that are appropriate for data protection,
considering the classification of data, associated risks, and usability of the
encryption technology.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership for the encryption algorithm is ""Shared (Independent""). The CSP is primarily responsible for determining and implementing the appropriate encryption algorithms in their infrastructure to ensure robust data protection. The CSP has the expertise and access to infrastructure to carry out this task, but it is the CSC's responsibility to opt for the CSP's encryption service and implement it as per business requirement, best practices and acceptable industry standard. 

Implementation Guidelines.
The CSP is responsible for implementing encryption algorithms that are most suitable for data protection, considering the data classification, associated risks, and usability of the encryption technology. 

The CSP should: 
a. Offer encryption services that use algorithms appropriate for various types of data protection. These algorithms should be consistent with up-to-date industry best practices and standards 
b. Ensure that the cryptographic libraries it uses are certified to approved standards, such as FIPS 140-2
c. Communicate clearly and transparently to CSCs about the encryption algorithms used, their strengths and weaknesses, and the types of data and risks they are suitable for
d. Continually monitor developments in encryption technology and threats to encryption security. This includes upgrading encryption services in response to new vulnerabilities and adopting new, more secure algorithms as they become available 
e. Adopt a risk-based approach when deciding on the appropriate key size and algorithm types, considering factors such as the level of risk to data and cost-benefit analysis 
f. Offer the flexibility to developers to choose the encryption algorithm as per their application's requirement while ensuring minimum security standards 
g. Ensure the CKMS security policies protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and source authentication of all keys, algorithms, and metadata
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC shares an independent control over the choice of encryption algorithms. While the CSP provides the cryptographic capabilities, the CSC is responsible for the proper selection and usage of these encryption services based on its specific data classification, associated risks, and business requirements. 

Implementation Guidelines.
The CSC should:
a. Familiarize itself with the encryption services provided by the CSP, including the available encryption algorithms and their appropriate use cases 
b. Select the appropriate encryption services based on the classification of its data, understanding that more sensitive data requires stronger encryption 
c. Consider the associated risks when choosing encryption algorithms. This includes understanding the potential impacts of data breaches and making informed decisions about the level of encryption required 
d. Ensure that the chosen encryption services meet all relevant compliance requirements. This may include industry-specific requirements for data protection, including reviewing and updating its use of encryption services. This also includes staying informed about developments in encryption technology and threats to encryption security, and adjusting their use of encryption services accordingly
e. Make use of any support offered by the CSP in understanding and using the encryption services. This includes leveraging documentation, customer support, and training resources
","1. Identify the encryption algorithms in use.
2. Confirm that identified encryption algorithms have been reviewed and approved by appropriate management.
3. Confirm that the encryption algorithm approval process includes assessment of the appropriateness of the algorithm for the data it is protecting, any associated risks, and the algorithm's usability.

"Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management",Encryption Change Management,CEK-05,"Establish a standard change management procedure, to accommodate
changes from internal and external sources, for review, approval, implementation
and communication of cryptographic, encryption and key management technology
changes.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
In an IaaS model, the CSP facilitates the platform for encryption and key management. The CSP oversees and independently manages changes to the cloud infrastructure, including the underlying hardware and network infrastructure. This independent handling of change management results in ""Shared (Independent)"" control ownership.

In the PaaS model, the CSP provides the platform where the cryptographic processes occur and where cryptographic material is exposed. While it handles changes related to the platform, the change management process involves an interaction with the CSC's application layer, creating a level of dependency. As a result, the control ownership falls under the ""Shared Dependent"") category.

In the SaaS model, the CSP takes on the most responsibility. It provides a full software solution, including encryption and key management. Hence, it is entirely responsible for managing changes to the software services, including the handling of cryptographic processes, making the control ownership 'CSP-Owned.'

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Implementation guidelines should include (but not be limited to):
a. establish a standard change management procedure for handling changes to cryptographic, encryption, and key management technologies. This includes changes resulting from internal reviews, as well as external factors such as changes to regulatory requirements or industry standards 
b. thoroughly review and approve changes before implementation, taking into account potential impact on security and compliance 
c. include provisions in change management procedures for documenting all changes, including the reasons for the changes and the expected benefits. This documentation should also include a rollback plan in case the changes need to be reversed if any risk or vulnerability is found in newly implemented changes in cryptography 
d. implement mechanisms to prevent unauthorized changes to software and systems, and to recover the system to a secure state in case unauthorized changes are detected 
e. conduct security audits to verify that the changes have been implemented correctly and have not introduced any new security risks 
f. report all audit results to the system authority, and promptly address any identified issues 
g. communicate with the CSC about any kind of change its their cryptography and key management lifecycle
","Control Ownership Rationale.
For IaaS, the CSCs are tasked with the responsibility to manage their encryption and key management on the provided infrastructure. Any changes to the cryptographic methods or keys, at the virtual machine or application level, are independently handled by the CSCs. This results in 'Shared Independent' control ownership.

In a PaaS model, while the CSP provides and manages the platform, the CSC implements their applications on it. Any changes to the encryption and key management at the application level require interaction with the provided platform, leading to an interdependence between the CSC and the CSP. Thus, the control ownership is classified as ""Shared Dependent.""
However, in a SaaS model, CSCs primarily use the software services provided by the CSPs. Any changes to the cryptographic processes are typically managed by the CSPs, including those pertaining to encryption and key management. Therefore, control ownership in this context is deemed to be 'CSP-Owned'.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Customer: 
a. establish its own change management procedures for cryptographic, encryption, and key management technologies used in its systems and applications
b. review and approve changes before implementation, considering their potential impact on security and compliance
c. include in change documentation the reasoning behind the changes, expected benefits, and a rollback plan
d. monitor its systems for unauthorized changes and be prepared to recover the system if necessary 

PaaS Customer:
a. Similar to IaaS, establish change management procedures for its applications
b. coordinate with the CSP to understand any changes to the platform's cryptographic, encryption, and key management technologies that may affect applications 

SaaS Customer:
a. understand and manage available settings in the SaaS application, including those related to cryptography
