Physical and logical assets then should inherit the sensitivity level of the data they handle, hence allowing for the CSP to classify them.\n \n The CSP is responsible for:\n • Providing a secure cloud environment that meets the security requirements of the CSC’s data\n • Classifying and documenting the physical and logical assets that are used to compute, store or transmit CSC data, according to the sensitivity levels of such data\n • Implementing security controls that are appropriate for the sensitivity level of the CSC data\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n CSPs should adhere to a comprehensive approach that aligns with the data sensitivity levels defined by the CSC. This involves understanding the CSC’s data classification policy, identifying and assessing the sensitivity of data stored on each asset, implementing appropriate security controls, and continuously monitoring and auditing asset security. \n \n Additionally, CSPs should document asset classification and security controls, train employees, and leverage automated tools to streamline the process and enhance data protection measures. By adopting these best practices, CSPs can effectively safeguard sensitive data and fulfill their contractual responsibilities as trusted partners in the cloud ecosystem.\n \n Implementation best practices for the CSP to classify and document the physical, and logical assets include (but not limited to):\n a. Asset Inventory and Tracking: The CSP should leverage an inventory of all physical and logical assets that are used to store, process, or transmit CSC data (refer to DCS-06), including physical equipment, such as servers and storage devices, as well as software components, such as network assets and configurations, virtual machines, operating systems and applications\n b. Asset Classification: The CSP should assess the sensitivity of data stored on each asset based on the CSC’s data classification policy. This assessment should take into account the type of CSC data, the potential harm that could be caused if the data were breached, and the legal and regulatory requirements for protecting the data\n c. Automated Tools for Assets Classification: The CSP can use automated tools to help with asset classification and security. These tools can scan assets for vulnerabilities and identify assets that are not in compliance with the asset classification policies\n d. Assets Classification Documentation: The CSP should document the classification of each asset and the security controls that are applied to the asset. This documentation should be made available to the CSC upon request\n e. Assets Tagging: The CSPs should assign unique tags or labels to physical and logical assets to facilitate identification, tracking, and management (refer to DCS-06).\n f. Apply Security Controls: Appropriate classification levels should be applied to physical and logical assets and appropriate security protection and controls in accordance to the sensitivity of the data stored on, processed or transmitted by the cloud asset\n g.

Data Usage Patterns: Data usage patterns, such as data access frequencies, data flows, and data processing activities could be shared with the CSP. This information can help the CSP understand the context in which your data is used and make informed classification decisions over the physical and logical assets.\n c. Regulatory Compliance Requirements: The CSP should be informed about applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements that apply to CSC data, such as industry standards or government regulations. This will ensure that these requirements are taken into account by the CSP when classifying assets and implementing security controls.\n d. Change Management and Communication: Open communication channels should be maintained with the CSP regarding any changes to physical and logical assets handling CSC data, or any changes to the CSC’s data classification policy or usage patterns.

The responsibility of this control implementation is \"Shared Dependent\" since the CSP should enable the CSC to access the catalog of CSP assets that are used to compute and store CSC data. The CSC should be empowered to retrieve the list of assets. It should be within the support of the CSP to assign descriptive metadata (tags) to assets for efficient and timely tracking, cost analysis, access control decisions, and alerting (by automation where applicable).\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n The CSP should employ a comprehensive solution (e.g., CMDB) for tracking inventory and managing the physical locations of servers and other data center assets, while phasing out paper-based and manual processes. A hosted asset tracking solution for servers, switches, datacenter asset tracking, and racks usually leverages a combination of technologies, such as passive radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning system (GPS), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and/or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with hardware roots-of-trust (HROT).\n \n The CSP should maintain a list of assets the CSC is using (e.g., cloud storage) or has provisioned (e.g., VMs) and provide tools to the CSC to access the CMDB and help it identify and tag the assets that handle CSC data. For instance, the CSP should share information about the assets that are used to store the CSC’s data (as well as the means to access them).\n \n This information can then be used by the CSC to catalog, tag, and track all the cloud relevant assets and services that are provided by the CSP, and to process and store CSC data (e.g., network, computational, and storage services).\n \n An EoL (End-of-Life) tracking system for all inventoried assets should be maintained. A process should be established to gather and maintain accurate EoL information for all inventoried assets within the cloud environment (e.g., manufacturer EoL dates for hardware and software, expiration dates for software/services, patch availability timelines). \n \n Automated EoL notifications within the asset inventory system should be implemented to trigger proactive security measures like scheduling asset retirement, migrating workloads, or disabling vulnerable assets nearing their end-of-life. Such notifications should be communicated to the CSC in a timely manner for seamless integration into the CSC’s change management framework.",

A standardized naming convention is the starting point for organizing the cloud-hosted resources. The same naming conventions on tags should be consistently used across multiple CSPs (e.g., multi-cloud environment), and where possible, cloud assets should be tracked by an automated means, allowing for prompt decisions to be made according to them (e.g., access control decisions, monitoring and alerting, accounting).\n \n Templates for defining a naming and tagging convention for tagging assets are defined by all major CSPs. The CSC may choose to adopt the CSP’s naming standards or define their own that they wish to apply to each asset type they plan to deploy as part of their cloud adoption effort.\n \n Examples of tagging conventions and respective cloud assets types that should be cataloged and tracked are below, where applicable by cloud service model (but not limited to):\n a. Asset Tags Types:\n i. Environment Tag: Identifying resources belonging to different environments such as production, development, or testing\n ii.

Security Classification Tag: Identifying the security classification or sensitivity level of resources\n viii. Compliance/Regulatory Tag: Indicate compliance with specific regulations or standards\n ix. Automation Tag: Indicate whether the asset should be selected for action by scripts, scanners or other form of automation\n x. Active Tag: Designates resources currently in use for production, development, or other relevant purposes\n xi. Deprecated Tag: Designates resources scheduled for retirement or no longer actively used\n b. Cloud Asset Types:\n i. Virtual machines (e.g., VM instances/images, OS name/version),\n ii. Virtual networking (e.g., VPC networks and subnets, DNS records, IP addresses),\n iii. Databases (e.g., database/SQL servers),\n iv. Storage (e.g., block, file, object storage types), \n v. Applications (e.g., custom applications, container images, software licenses)\n \n The catalog should include all device status changes (e.g., patch levels, lost/decommissioned status, and to whom the asset type is assigned, or approved for BYOD).\n \n Cloud asset cataloging and tracking should be prioritized to include the most security-relevant or critical ones followed by the inclusion of remaining asset types that pertain to minimal or no risk.\n \n If supported by the CSP, automated scans should be made to identify assets that are not tagged or have tagged values not aligned to CSC’s tagging rules (e.g., assets tagged or not tagged with a ‘classification level’ value).\n \n When tagging tools are not made available from the CSP, the CSC should proceed with manually tagging and cataloging assets. Easy-to-parse formats (JSON, YAML, XML) should be preferred for more efficient management and maintenance of the catalog.\n \n The CSC should map security tools to the assets included in the catalog in order to prevent, detect, recover, and respond to security risks that are applicable to them (e.g., use vulnerabilities patching and antivirus tools with VM/OS assets as preventive and detective security controls).\n \n Assets that have been tagged with a ‘Security Classification Level’ key type should inherit the highest data classification level (high-water mark) value among the different classification levels of data that the particular asset type is destined to use for performing computational, network or storage operations on such data."
