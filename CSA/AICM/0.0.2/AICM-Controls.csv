",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and Cloud Service Customer (CSC) are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to independently develop policies and procedures in order to meet their own business needs, audit, assurance, and compliance requirements. 
The CSP’s assertion for conducting an audit of its cloud stack does not extend to the CSC’s use of the cloud and its compliance requirements to standards and regulatory scope. The CSP’s attestation should also consider subservice organizations that it relies upon to provide key services, e.g., infrastructure hosting.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should establish formal policies and procedures based on industry best practices and relevant standards to educate its personnel of the required baseline for information security standards and guidelines. It should establish and document an approved and organized approach to its regulatory and contractual requirements, or security requirements in standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, AICPA TSC (SOC 2), and CSA CCM in order to prepare and plan its audit and assurance activities.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives:

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own regulatory and contractual obligations. The CSP’s independent audit and assurance assessments may be utilized to gauge the security posture of its own cloud services’ infrastructure.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should regularly conduct independent assurance and audit activities as established by A&A-01. The CSP should also conform and provide a platform to prove that compliance controls are applied and in accordance with relevant standards.
The audit activities may vary in scope to cover more or less specific areas in a rotational time frame to make sure the whole of the organization and its service provisions include at least some audit activities throughout the year.

Audits and assurance in terms of this control could mean:
a. Independent verification of self-assessments 
b. Physical control reviews and evidence-based claim assessments
c. Performance or testing control effectiveness such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and red team exercises

Audit activities should be conducted by a competent independent internal or external party. 

The CSP may choose to implement a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) tool, either its own or a third-party solution, to enhance audit and assurance activities.

The CSP should not rely only on self assessments, internal gap analysis, or any other metrics that are produced by internal auditing, internal scans, etc., since internal self-alerting biases may exist.

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own risk-based plans and policies, regulatory and contractual obligations. The CSP’s independent audit and assurance assessments may be utilized to gauge the security posture of its own cloud services’ infrastructure. However, the CSC should also perform independent assessments of the CSP to demonstrate compliance with its own (CSC’s) requirements. Both CSP and CSC are responsible for reviewing the impact of changing risks on audit and assurance assessments.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should implement a regime of independent assurance and audit activities using a risk-based approach. The CSP is recommended to adhere to operational activities and procedures in auditing and risk management standards.

Because the CSC will generally need to rely on the independent audits, assessments, and attestations engaged by and for the CSP, the CSP should ensure that the objectives and scopes of the independent assurance activities are clearly defined and that the objectives and scopes are documented and communicated with adequate clarity and specificity to the CSC.

In particular, the CSP's documentation of objectives and scope should be clear, unambiguous, and have specific delineation as to which cloud services, which resources (including data), and which service features and options were assessed. This permits the CSC to adequately and appropriately rely on the assurance activities and reports provided by the CSP.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.
The CSC, if relying on the CSP’s controls and assessments, should review their suitability based on its own risks.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSC should implement an effective risk-based internal and external audit scheme. Internal audit risk assessments should be performed by a team internal to the CSC. It should determine priority, details to be considered, frequency of audit, and general risks to which the CSC is exposed. External assessments should be performed by an independent organization.

The CSC’s Audit Manager should prepare reports showing the audit scope and cycle. It should work with auditors to evaluate the risks posed to various departments and functions. 

Audits may leverage System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports and others from independent third parties. 

The CSC's deployment model choice is informed by the business needs and the responsibilities it is willing to assume.

When relying on independent audits, assessments, attestations, and other third-party assurances provided by the CSP, the CSC should pay careful attention to the documented objectives and scope to ensure they adequately cover the services consumed by the CSC.

The CSC should perform the following to achieve its obligations within the SSRM:
Conduct independent third-party compliance audit and assurance activities in line with regulations and standards
Regularly update and reassess audit and assurance activities within scope and criteria
","1. Examine the process for determining the risks applicable to the organization's systems and environments.
2. Determine if a list of such risks is maintained and reviewed.

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own cloud security, regulatory and contractual requirements. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should conduct audits and assessments against industry standards, regulations and statutory requirements depending on the services and the jurisdictions in which they operate.

The CSP should implement a process to identify and document legal and regulatory requirements that impact its cloud service offering, both within itself and with third-party suppliers that operate on its behalf.

The process should:
a. Cover the jurisdictions, i.e., regions, countries, states, where the organization conducts business
b. Incorporate the following:
i. Security-specific legislations or regulations
ii. Legislations or regulations which has security control implications
c. Identify the regulatory, statutory, contractual, or other compliance requirements to which the cloud service, its associated systems, and its data are subject
d. Identify the respective specific technical and administrative compliance requirements that are required for the data, technology, and processes comprising and supporting the cloud service. In general, this should include:
i. objects and data elements, system settings and capabilities, metadata, events, activities, and processes subject to any special regulatory requirements
ii. what specific requirements apply to objects, system settings, metadata, activity, and processes
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control’s implementation responsibility is shared between the CSP and CSC and each party should independently implement it. 
More specifically, the audit of a CSP might cover only a portion of the technology stack used by a CSC. This audit excludes how CSCs utilize the stack, configure services, manage access, monitor service usage, and choose what data to place in the cloud. Consequently, even if the CSP complies with relevant standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements, CSCs still need to assess their own cloud activities for compliance. 
To this end, CSCs should implement suitable controls and processes regardless of whether the CSP demonstrates adherence to the same standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements. Therefore, the CSC should be aware that it should not rely solely on the CSP’s independent audits and need to conduct its own audit activities.

Implementation Guidelines.

Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should maintain a Risk Management program to mitigate and manage risk. Management should have a process that requires it to identify risks within its area of responsibility and to implement appropriate measures to address those risks.

Findings of audit and assurance activities should be given due care and attention at the appropriate levels. If a control deficiency (finding) is identified, the deficiency should be evaluated for prioritization. Once prioritized, the appropriate risk treatment should be selected.

Options to treat risks should be clearly defined and evaluated, which could include:
a. Mitigating risk by increasing the effectiveness of controls
b. Mitigating the risk by implementing compensating controls
c. Avoiding all or part of the risk (i.e., deciding not to pursue a particular business initiative)
d. Accepting all or part of the risk

Use Case Example:
The metric of ""Percentage of vulnerabilities remediated within a specified timeframe"" is taken as an example to see how it applies to the technical measures provided in this control. This metric falls under the Vulnerability Management domain and measures the effectiveness of vulnerability remediation efforts.
a. Purpose and Scope Determination:
i. Objective: To measure the organization's ability to timely remediate vulnerabilities and reduce the window of exposure to potential attacks
ii. Scope: All cloud applications and infrastructure components
b. Key Security Domains: Unpatched vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or compromise systems
c. Measurable Parameters: The metric ""Percentage of vulnerabilities remediated within a specified timeframe"" directly quantifies the organization's vulnerability remediation performance
d. Thresholds and Benchmarks:
i. Set a target threshold for vulnerability remediation, such as remediating 90% of critical vulnerabilities within 7 days and 70% of high-severity vulnerabilities within 14 days
ii. Compare metric performance against industry benchmarks or internal targets to assess vulnerability remediation effectiveness
e. Data Collection and Aggregation:
i. Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities across cloud applications and infrastructure components
ii. Integrate vulnerability scan results with a central vulnerability management platform to track remediation progress
f. Data Analysis and Visualization:
i. Generate reports and dashboards that track the percentage of vulnerabilities remediated within the specified timeframe

CSPs should leverage an SSDLC process to ensure that applications and APIs are securely designed, developed, deployed, and operated in their cloud environments. Integration of security best practices throughout the entire development lifecycle, can help CSPs to effectively protect their applications from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks.

Defining security requirements should be the first step in the SSDLC process to ensure that security is integrated throughout all phases of development. Security requirements should derive from security objectives and/or organizational goals and regulatory requirements. Industry standards should be applied at project inception and every stage of the SSDLC process. To successfully promote SSDLC security, roles and expectations should be clearly defined, published and communicated to relevant stakeholders.

The following best practices should be followed when implementing an SSDLC:
a. SSDLC Governance: A security governance framework should be implemented that is tailored to the SSDLC and that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability for security throughout the SSDLC
i. The CSP’s SSDLC processes, at a minimum, should meet the regulatory and CSC’s business requirements
ii. The CSP should provide information to CSCs about the SSDLC to the extent compatible with their disclosure policies
b. DevSecOps: A DevSecOps approach should be defined and implemented that integrates security practices into all stages of the SSDLC, from planning and design to development, testing, deployment, and operation, rather than being an afterthought
c. Threat Modeling: Threat modeling should be incorporated into the early stages of the SSDLC to identify potential security risks and design mitigation strategies to help developers anticipate and proactively address security issues, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced later in the development cycle
d. Secure Coding Practices: 
i. Comprehensive security design requirements should be defined that specify the security measures and controls to be implemented throughout the application's architecture
ii. Industry standard (OWASP, etc) secure coding guidelines should be incorporated in the SSDLC
iii. Secure coding guidelines should be followed and implemented respectively (e.g., proper implementation and configuration of security headers, input validation, information output handling, error handling, and proper use of cryptographic libraries)
e. Open Source Components Secure Use: Secure practices for managing open-source components should be employed, including thorough vulnerability scanning, dependency management, and continuous monitoring for known vulnerabilities. Use trusted open-source repositories and ensure proper attribution and licensing compliance
f. Vulnerability Management: Continuously scan for and remediate vulnerabilities in code, infrastructure, and third-party components (refer to TVM domain)
g. Security Testing: Regular security audits, static, dynamic application security testing, and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential security weaknesses (refer to AIS-05 and TVM-06)
h. Secure Deployment and Configuration Management:
i. Secure deployment and configuration management practices should be implemented to ensure that cloud-based applications are deployed and configured in a secure manner
ii. Automated tools should be used to enforce consistent configurations and monitor for deviations from security policies
i. EoL Process: When an application reaches its end-of-life, a CSP should at minimum:
i. Notify CSCs of the EoL date and provide clear instructions on how to migrate to alternative services
ii. Discontinue providing technical support and updates for the application and archive the application's source code and documentation
iii. Ensure that all application associated data is properly deleted or transferred to the CSC's designated location
iv. Review and assess potential security vulnerabilities during the decommissioning process

The CSPs should be transparent about their security practices and provide CSCs with the necessary tools and support to meet their security requirements. The CSCs should actively engage with CSPs to ensure that their security requirements are implemented and maintained throughout the SSDLC.

Both parties and each independently are responsible for implementing a robust testing strategy which includes acceptance criteria of new information systems, upgrades and new versions.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
As early as the development phase of the SSDLC, the CSP should incorporate security testing to facilitate the identification of security flaws by developers, enabling timely remediation and minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced into production. 

The following best practices should be followed for implementing an applications security testing strategy:
a. SSDLC and Testing Management: The development team should follow the SSDLC with security best practices to create code that is secure by design, as well as use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify security loopholes present in the code
b. Continuous CI/CD Testing: Continuous testing should be built into CI/CD pipelines: 
i. Understand that CI/CD is just not delivering the code, rather also an opportunity to adopt a “shift-left” approach with continuous testing
ii. Pre-commit and post-commit hooks should be implemented and used
iii. A vulnerability scanner should be used to identify any third-party library issues
iv. An automated scanner should be used to identify hardcoded / default secrets, including access keys, secret key, credentials, private keys, etc.
c. Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST should be used to analyze the application's source code, bytecode, or binary code to detect issues early in the development lifecycle and identify security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers (e.g., data/control flow, taint analysis)
d. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): DAST should be used to test the application in its running state to identify security vulnerabilities by sending requests and analyzing the responses (e.g., fuzz testing, session hijacking, injection testing)
e. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST): IAST should be used to combine elements of both SAST and DAST, identify security issues without the need for source code access, and provide real-time feedback on security vulnerabilities during the application's runtime
f. Penetration Testing: Penetration tests should be performed to simulate real-world cyberattacks to identify potential vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of the security measures in place
g. Input Validation: Input validation test cases should be used to identify injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Command Injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This includes checking the type, format, length, and range of input data to ensure that it adheres to predefined criteria and does not contain any malicious or unauthorized content
h. Information Output Handling: Information output filtering test cases should be used to identify information exfiltration attacks (e.g., cleartext output of passwords)
i. Industry Best Practices: Security test cases should be employed according to OWASP Top 10. Consider also aligning test cases with various compliance standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, AICPA TSC) depending on organizational strategy and requirements
j. Continuous Monitoring: Continuous monitoring should be required once an application is deployed to test for a crash, DoS, DDoS, unauthenticated scans, etc.
k. Applications Testing Automation: 
i. The test team should leverage automation to expedite the testing completion process and for efficacy in reducing errors and surfacing security gaps
ii. Automated tools should test applications for both known and unknown vulnerabilities
iii. Criteria should be developed for assessing the automation required by an application, as not all systems will benefit equally

At minimum, the above multiple test types and integration points are needed to provide the appropriate level of assurance throughout a SSDLC.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
In the IaaS and PaaS models, the CSC owns the application stack and should make sure of its secure testing and deployment in the cloud (see CSP guidelines).  In the SaaS model, the CSC responsibility arises from the fact that SaaS CSPs typically offer ready-to-use applications and services, while the CSC remains accountable for configuring and customizing these services to meet their specific needs and requirements. Consequently, the CSC should ensure that the criteria for upgrades, modifications, or acceptance of new systems and versions align with their organizational security standards, compliance requirements, and application-specific needs. By implementing a rigorous testing strategy, the SaaS CSC can verify the compatibility, appropriate security, and proper functionality of the upgrades or new systems before their integration into the organization's workflow.

Implementation Guidelines.
For the IaaS and PaaS CSC, as part of a comprehensive testing strategy, the same guidelines as for the CSP apply, and additionally ensure the proper configuration, upgrades, and secure integration of new systems and new versions of systems and applications. 

In particular with respect to the SaaS CSC, the following implementation guidelines apply:
a. Configuration of Applications: The SaaS customer should configure the application settings and permissions according to their specific business requirements, ensuring that access controls, user privileges, and data encryption are appropriately set up to mitigate security risks and maintain data privacy
b. Application Upgrades: Prior to implementing any application upgrades, the SaaS customer should conduct thorough testing, including functional, compatibility, and security testing, to ensure that the upgrades do not disrupt the existing workflows or compromise the application's security posture. This also involves maintaining a rollback plan in case any issues arise during the upgrade process
c. Secure Integration of New Systems: The SaaS customer should evaluate the compatibility of the new systems with the existing infrastructure and conduct comprehensive integration testing to ensure that data integrity, security protocols, and application functionalities are maintained throughout the integration process. Secure authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and access controls should be implemented to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities during the integration of new version systems

Automation of security testing should be implemented to reduce risks and errors and enable the scaling of security practices to meet organizational demands. Multiple test types and integration points will likely be needed to provide the appropriate level of assurance throughout a SSDLC. Criteria should be developed for assessing the automation required by an application, as not all systems will benefit equally.
","1. Examine policy and procedures for definition of testing strategies, automation of security testing, and change management.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The following best practices should be followed for implementing an applications secure deployment strategy:
a. Standardized Deployment Process: Standardized deployment processes should be implemented to ensure consistent and secure application deployments. This includes:
i. Security requirements definition based on application deployment needs and industry standards to ensure applications are protected from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cybersecurity threats
ii. Automated deployment pipelines CI/CD should be established to automate the deployment process, minimizing manual intervention and errors
iii. Standardized deployment templates should be developed that encapsulate best practices and configurations for common application scenarios

Application & Interface Security,Application Vulnerability Remediation,AIS-07,"Define and implement a process to remediate application security
vulnerabilities, automating remediation when possible.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility of this control is a shared responsibility between the CSP and CSC, however doing so independently from one another. The CSP is responsible for defining and implementing a process to remediate application security vulnerabilities and automating remediation when possible.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Application security vulnerabilities are a serious threat to cloud-based applications. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to applications, steal sensitive data, and disrupt operations. CSPs play a critical role in helping CSCs remediate application security vulnerabilities.

The following best practices should be followed for implementing a vulnerability remediation process:
a. Vulnerability Remediation Scope: A process for defining the scope of a vulnerability remediation should be established (e.g., IaaS CSPs may only be responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure, while PaaS CSPs may also be responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in the platform software)
b. Remediation Plan: A remediation plan for each vulnerability should be developed and include the steps that need to be taken to remediate the vulnerability, the estimated time to remediate the vulnerability, and the resources that will be required
i. The plan should include processes and procedures for vulnerabilities remediation in coordination with development teams, the CSC, and for implementing security patches in a timely manner
c. Remediation Prioritization and Risk Assessment:
i. The severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities should be assessed based on factors such as exploitability, target scope, and potential consequences
ii. Vulnerability assessment tools should be utilized to provide risk scores
iii. Vulnerabilities remediation should be prioritized based on their risk scores, considering factors such as business criticality, asset value, regulatory compliance requirements, and industry standard vulnerability scoring systems such as CVSS if applicable
iv. Threat intelligence feeds should be incorporated into the prioritization process to identify vulnerabilities actively exploited by attackers
d. Track and Measure Progress: Progress on remediation efforts should be tracked and the effectiveness of the vulnerability remediation process measured
e. Patch Management Automation: Application of patches should be automated to reduce the time and effort required to remediate vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of cloud-based applications (refer to TVM domain)
f. Remediation Automation:
i. Configuration management tools should be utilized to automatically correct misconfigured security settings and enforce secure configurations across different environments using secure by default principles
ii. Automated code refactoring tools should be employed to address insecure coding practices and enforce secure coding guidelines within applications
iii. Automated dependency management tools should be utilized to update and replace vulnerable open-source components with patched or updated versions
iv. Automated remediation hooks should be implemented within the CI/CD pipeline to automatically remediate identified vulnerabilities before and after deployment
g. Remediation Logging: Comprehensive logging of remediation activities should be established to track the remediation process and identify potential issues
h. Post-Remediation Verification: Post-remediation verification steps should be implemented to ensure that vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed and that no new vulnerabilities have been introduced
i. Continuous Remediation Monitoring: The effectiveness of the vulnerability remediation process should be continuously monitored and improvements made as needed
j. Notification and Reporting: Notification and reporting mechanisms should be established to inform relevant stakeholders of any vulnerabilities detected and remediation actions taken
i. Communicate with CSCs any identified vulnerabilities and the plan to remediate them. Communication should be timely and transparent in accordance with agreed SLAs

Vulnerabilities should be identified and remediated as early as possible in the SSDLC and automated processes are ideal for such a task.

Vulnerability Scanning and Remediation Examples:
To ensure that only secure and hardened container images are used in the application development process, integrate a vulnerability scanner into the CI/CD pipeline specifically for ""image"" scanning. This will guarantee that only secure ""images"" (also known as golden images) are incorporated into the application software builds.

Automated scanning tools are an effective solution for identifying and remediating such issues. For instance, cloud agent-based tools can be deployed on each active VM instance to continuously scan for third-party security vulnerabilities, with the frequency of scans determined by the organization's security strategy (daily, weekly, etc.).
","Control Ownership Rationale.
Widespread vulnerabilities may require action by both the CSP and CSC, however the CSC is responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in their cloud environment.  

In the SaaS model, the CSC is responsible for identifying vulnerabilities related to any application-level misconfigurations (e.g., API configuration settings, access control settings) that are within the control of the CSC. Therefore, while the SaaS customer is not responsible for identifying infrastructure and insecure code related vulnerabilities on the SaaS application it consumes, it may have to coordinate with the CSP to identify, understand, and manage any vulnerabilities related to the application stack the CSC owns and controls, including the applications vulnerabilities remediation and response scheduling.

Implementation Guidelines.
The implementation guidelines as provided for the CSP apply to IaaS, PaaS CSC.

In addition, as it pertains to the SaaS CSC, misconfigurations can be considered a vulnerability, as they can inadvertently expose the application to security risks and potential breaches.
SaaS CSC implementation guidelines for application security vulnerabilities remediation include:
a. Configuration Management: Ensuring that the application's configuration settings are appropriately set up to align with the organization's security requirements and best practices. This involves properly configuring access controls, user permissions, and encryption settings (including the use of strong encryption protocols and properly managed encryption keys)
b. Default Security Configurations: Customize and strengthen default security configurations to align with organizational security policies. To remediate such vulnerabilities: 
i. Regularly review and update default security settings to address emerging security threats
ii. Conduct regular security assessments to identify any weaknesses in default security settings
c. Access Control Management: Implementing robust access controls and authentication mechanisms to regulate user access and privileges within the SaaS application. This includes managing user roles, permissions, and identity verification to prevent unauthorized access and unauthorized activities within the application
d. Unmanaged Shadow IT and Unsanctioned Applications: Usage of unsanctioned or unmanaged applications by employees within the SaaS CSC organization can introduce security risks and vulnerabilities that may not be adequately addressed or monitored by the SaaS CSP. To remediate such vulnerabilities:
i. Implement strict policies to prevent the use of unsanctioned applications and shadow IT
ii. Provide clear guidelines and recommendations to personnel for approved applications and IT resources
iii. Monitor network traffic and application usage to detect any unauthorized or unmanaged applications
","1. Examine the policy and procedures to remediate application security vulnerabilities and automating remediation.
2. Evaluate whether roles and responsibilities, including escalation paths for application security incident response and remediation, are defined and effective.
3. Determine if the organization leverages automation when possible and if this automation increases remediation efficiency.

Each party is expected to have different business continuity management and operational resilience requirements that they should achieve respectively to their geographical location, contractual, and regulatory ecosystem. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Establishing policies and procedures for business continuity management (BCM) and operational resilience is imperative for CSPs to maintain uninterrupted cloud services delivery, promptly recover from disruptions, and effectively manage crises. For CSCs, the implementation of these policies provides continuous access to critical services, even in the face of unforeseen events or cyber threats. CSCs can rely on the CSP's commitment to operational resilience, knowing that robust measures are in place to safeguard against disruptions and swiftly respond to incidents.

Business Continuity Management and Operational Resilience,Response Plan Exercise,BCR-10,"Exercise the disaster response plan annually or upon significant
changes, including if possible local emergency authorities.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The ownership is “Shared (Dependent)” because, although aspects of many activities, such as creating plans, can be done independently, disaster recovery and its associated testing implicates the restoration of CSP services and the testing of such recovery and therefore the exercise of the response plan can and often does require the CSC’s dependence on the CSP, especially when testing certain CSP-provided resilience capabilities (e.g., intra-region or inter-region failovers, etc.).
The CSP is responsible for their own tests of DR on their infrastructure and services.
Exercises and tests help management validate continuity and resilience of technology components, including systems, networks, applications, and data, that support critical business functions. The type or combination of methods should be determined by the entity’s size, complexity, and nature of its business. Comprehensive testing of all critical functions and applications allows the CSP to identify potential problems; therefore, the CSP should use one of the more thorough testing methods discussed in this section to verify the BCP’s viability. Exercises may include performing duties in a simulated environment (i.e., functional), be discussion-based (i.e., tabletop), or be full-scale or limited-scale.

Implementation Guidelines.

Business Continuity Management and Operational Resilience,Equipment Redundancy,BCR-11,"Supplement business-critical equipment with redundant equipment independently
located at a reasonable minimum distance in accordance with applicable industry
standards.
",CSP-Owned,CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility for this control is exclusively owned by the CSP, because the CSP is the owner of the business-critical equipment, and responsible for supplementing it with redundancy measures and placing it at an appropriate location of acceptable risk. The CSP is responsible for providing the CSC with redundant equipment and information about the control implementation. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The strategic placement and construction of data centers are of paramount importance to CSPs. The location of a data center should be carefully considered to minimize disruptions caused by natural phenomena. Factors such as ease of cooling, seismic stability, flood risk, and geopolitical stability must be meticulously evaluated.

Prior to data center implementation, CSPs should conduct a comprehensive site assessment to proactively mitigate potential risks associated with the cloud infrastructure. Engaging with relevant industry groups and standards organizations, can provide valuable insights and guidance during the decision-making process.

The CSP’s redundancy strategy should be compliant with the requirements declared in contracts and SLA with the CSC.

Implementation best practices for equipment redundancy include (but not limited):
a. Business-Critical Equipment Identification: The equipment that is essential for maintaining core business operations should be identified (e.g., servers, storage systems, network devices, and any other infrastructure components that are critical for data processing, communication, and application availability)
b. Equipment Redundancy Strategy: 
i. Redundancy strategies should be aligned with business requirements, business impact analysis, and risk assessments to ensure optimal resource allocation and protection against critical failures
ii. The level of redundancy required should be assessed for each business-critical component. This may vary depending on the criticality of the equipment, the potential impact of downtime, and the organization's risk tolerance
iii. Proactively assess, mitigate, and remediate potential risks associated with regional or location-specific failures to maintain service continuity
iv. Management plans, including tools and interfaces, should be developed and implemented to effectively manage redundancy and maintain service operations uninterrupted
v. Cloud infrastructure services from reputable CSPs that offer redundant data centers across multiple geographical locations should be utilized
vi. Systems Redundancy Examples:
• Equip all critical systems with redundant power supplies to mitigate the risk of power failures. Use separate power grids or sources to ensure diversity
• Implement diverse network paths to avoid a single point of failure. Use multiple internet service providers (ISPs) and establish redundant connections between data centers
• Deploy redundant hardware components, such as servers, storage, and networking equipment
• Utilize technologies like load balancing and failover clustering to distribute the workload across redundant systems
• Implement data replication, backups, across geographically dispersed data centers to ensure data availability in case of a site failure
c. Redundancy Architecture Documentation: A detailed documentation of the redundancy strategy and devised architecture and configurations should be created and maintained
d. Geographical Dispersion: Mirrored or redundant equipment should be implemented at separate data centers located at a reasonable minimum distance from each other to minimize the risk of simultaneous outages caused by localized events, such as natural disasters or power disruptions
i. A multi-location (i.e., redundant systems are deployed across multiple locations within a region) and multi-region redundancy strategy  (redundant systems are deployed across multiple regions, each consisting of multiple locations) should be adopted and implemented where possible
ii. Data replication strategies should be implemented to ensure data consistency and availability across redundant data centers 
e. Automated Failover Mechanisms: Automated failover mechanisms should be configured to seamlessly switch traffic to the redundant equipment in the event of a primary equipment failure to ensure that operations continue uninterrupted without manual intervention
f. Testing and Maintenance: Regular testing of redundant equipment should be conducted to ensure its readiness and functionality. Establish a comprehensive maintenance plan for both primary and redundant equipment to maintain system performance and reliability
g. Continuous Improvement: Redundancy strategies should be regularly reviewed and updated based on evolving business needs, technological advancements and according with industry standards and any relevant regulatory requirements

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control's implementation responsibility is shared for both CSP and CSC, however, each should implement this control independently from one another. The change management policy and procedures should be managed and baselined independently by each party, the CSP and CSC within their respective corporate business needs, requirements and in alignment with industry standards.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Establishing robust change control and configuration management processes is essential for CSPs to ensure the stability, security, and reliability of their cloud services. Change control processes ensure that changes to the cloud environment are carefully planned, reviewed, approved, and implemented in a controlled manner. This helps prevent unauthorized or unintended changes that could disrupt service delivery or compromise security. Configuration management processes, on the other hand, focus on maintaining consistent and accurate configurations across the cloud environment, ensuring that systems are properly configured and compliant with security standards and business requirements.
The CSP has responsibility for the design, implementation, and management of all supporting infrastructure — virtual elastic compute, server operating systems, storage, and networking — and also middleware, development tools, business intelligence services, and database management systems. A change management process should be in operation to ensure all proposed changes to the services consumed by the CSC are governed and subjected to formal procedures. Applications should be configured as contractually agreed upon.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: The scope, objectives, roles and responsibilities for the change management process and should be aligned with the organization's strategic goals, business requirements, and security policies, and comply with the relevant laws, regulations, and standards
i. Create a Change Control Board (CCB) that is responsible for reviewing and approving all change requests
ii. Form a dedicated change management team responsible for overseeing and executing the change management process

m. Maintenance and Reviews: The change control and configuration management policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC is responsible for establishing its own change management processes, including policies and procedures to ensure all proposed changes to contracted services are governed and subjected to formal processes including impact analysis, roll back upon change failure, and service threat/likelihood analyses so services will not suffer unexpected degradation or outage. Sufficiently skilled Change Managers should be appointed to review planned changes during formally scheduled review meetings.

Implementation Guidelines.
Given that the CSC manages all aspects of the applications lifecycle and business services developed using the supporting applications, the full documented and annually reviewed change management process should be in place for the application and data layers.

The SaaS model expects the CSP to provide a complete software solution that the CSC purchases on a pay-as-you-go basis. The CSC is expected to manage the SaaS application security controls and endpoints connecting to the service.

SaaS CSCs should consider a variety of secure configuration policy requirements and controls when managing their SaaS applications to protect their data. Here are some key areas to focus on:

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a “Shared (Independent)” responsibility between the CSP and the CSC as the creation of a Cryptography, Encryption and Key Management policy by each party is essential for effective security. The CSP should offer cryptography services, and in such a case it is responsible for the infrastructure that supports these services. The CSC, on the other hand, is responsible for correctly using these services to secure their data, for instance, choosing when and what data to encrypt, and managing access to encryption keys.

Implementation Guidelines.
The CSP should have a robust system for cryptographic management with clear policies and procedures for encryption and key management, including key generation, distribution, rotation, revocation, destruction, activation, suspension, deactivation, archival, compromise, recovery, inventory management, purposes, and access. These policies should be reviewed and updated at least annually.

IaaS Provider:
Policies and procedures should be in place that dictate how and when these encryption methods are to be used, who has access to the keys, how the lifecycle of these keys is managed, roles and responsibilities, data protection, change management, risk management, monitoring, reporting, incident handling, and audit. An IaaS provider should offer mechanisms for encryption both in transit and at rest for all data, along with a key management service. The CSP should ensure that these services comply with the latest security standards and best practices.

PaaS Provider:
Policies and procedures should be in place to guide the usage and management of these encryption methods and keys, including change management and risk management practices. A PaaS provider should offer platform-level encryption for data at rest and in transit, including a secure key management system. The CSP should adhere to security best practices and standards, including data protection protocols like data encryption and algorithm selection.

SaaS Provider:
Policies and procedures should be in place that dictate how encryption is handled at the application level, including key management, again featuring the full spectrum of key management activities. The provider should ensure all data at rest and in transit is encrypted using approved cryptographic protection methods. The CSP should offer the CSC the ability to manage their own keys where feasible and monitor the technology closely to keep up with emergence of threats and vulnerabilities. The CSP should ensure incident handling procedures, audit mechanisms, and activity logging for encryption and key management processes.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives:
i. Scope definition and governance of the organization's use of cryptography, encryption, and key management practices to protect sensitive data

This is a “Shared (Independent)” responsibility between the CSP and CSC, because the CSP is responsible for defining and implementing roles and responsibilities for cryptographic operations and key management inside their organization. In order to correspond with the CSC's individual security demands, the CSP is expected to provide configurable options related to these duties. However, the CSP has no control over how the CSC manages the options presented, making the role 'independent'. Depending on the tools and features provided, the CSP might influence the CSC's roles and responsibilities, in particular with service models such as SaaS.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Provider:

b. implement robust encryption and key management practices for the CSC data at rest, in transit, and in use, providing it with transparency about these practices
c. offer options for the CSC to manage its own encryption keys where possible (e.g., bring-your-own-key-scenarios, aka BYOK), and support the CSC in the secure implementation of these options
d. establish the rules for the management of the storage and recovery of operational and backed-up key information.

Applicable to all service models:
a. define and follow key lifecycle responsibilities, including key generation, distribution, cryptoperiod establishment, key revocation, storage and recovery, integrity checks, and destruction of keys when they are no longer required
b. conduct regular audits and reviews to ensure compliance and check the effectiveness of segregation of duties, roles, and responsibilities
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership for the CSC is also “Shared (Independent”). This results from the CSC's need to identify and implement roles and responsibilities to appropriately utilize and manage the CSP's cryptographic operations and key management options. While the CSP provides the essential tools and options, it is the responsibility of the CSC to develop roles and operational procedures that are appropriate for its specific needs and operational context. In certain service models, such as SaaS, the CSC's role may be shaped by the CSP's options and tools, but the primary responsibility for defining and implementing roles and responsibilities remains with the CSC.

",Shared (Dependent),CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
In an IaaS model, the CSP facilitates the platform for encryption and key management. The CSP oversees and independently manages changes to the cloud infrastructure, including the underlying hardware and network infrastructure. This independent handling of change management results in “Shared (Independent)” control ownership.

In the PaaS model, the CSP provides the platform where the cryptographic processes occur and where cryptographic material is exposed. While it handles changes related to the platform, the change management process involves an interaction with the CSC’s application layer, creating a level of dependency. As a result, the control ownership falls under the “Shared Dependent”) category.

In the SaaS model, the CSP takes on the most responsibility. It provides a full software solution, including encryption and key management. Hence, it is entirely responsible for managing changes to the software services, including the handling of cryptographic processes, making the control ownership 'CSP-Owned.’

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Implementation guidelines should include (but not be limited to):
a. establish a standard change management procedure for handling changes to cryptographic, encryption, and key management technologies. This includes changes resulting from internal reviews, as well as external factors such as changes to regulatory requirements or industry standards 
b. thoroughly review and approve changes before implementation, taking into account potential impact on security and compliance 
c. include provisions in change management procedures for documenting all changes, including the reasons for the changes and the expected benefits. This documentation should also include a rollback plan in case the changes need to be reversed if any risk or vulnerability is found in newly implemented changes in cryptography 
d. implement mechanisms to prevent unauthorized changes to software and systems, and to recover the system to a secure state in case unauthorized changes are detected 
e. conduct security audits to verify that the changes have been implemented correctly and have not introduced any new security risks 
f. report all audit results to the system authority, and promptly address any identified issues 
g. communicate with the CSC about any kind of change its their cryptography and key management lifecycle
","Control Ownership Rationale.
For IaaS, the CSCs are tasked with the responsibility to manage their encryption and key management on the provided infrastructure. Any changes to the cryptographic methods or keys, at the virtual machine or application level, are independently handled by the CSCs. This results in 'Shared Independent' control ownership.

In a PaaS model, while the CSP provides and manages the platform, the CSC implements their applications on it. Any changes to the encryption and key management at the application level require interaction with the provided platform, leading to an interdependence between the CSC and the CSP. Thus, the control ownership is classified as “Shared Dependent.”
However, in a SaaS model, CSCs primarily use the software services provided by the CSPs. Any changes to the cryptographic processes are typically managed by the CSPs, including those pertaining to encryption and key management.

Datacenter Security,Assets Classification,DCS-05,"Classify and document the physical, and logical assets (e.g., applications)
based on the organizational business risk.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility for this control is shared between the CSP and CSC, and it is a dependent responsibility, since in order for the CSP to properly classify the physical and logical assets of the cloud infrastructure it manages, the CSC needs to communicate to the CSP the sensitivity levels of the data that has deployed in the cloud. Physical and logical assets then should inherit the sensitivity level of the data they handle, hence allowing for the CSP to classify them.

The CSP is responsible for:
• Providing a secure cloud environment that meets the security requirements of the CSC’s data
• Classifying and documenting the physical and logical assets that are used to compute, store or transmit CSC data, according to the sensitivity levels of such data
• Implementing security controls that are appropriate for the sensitivity level of the CSC data

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CSPs should adhere to a comprehensive approach that aligns with the data sensitivity levels defined by the CSC. This involves understanding the CSC’s data classification policy, identifying and assessing the sensitivity of data stored on each asset, implementing appropriate security controls, and continuously monitoring and auditing asset security. 

Additionally, CSPs should document asset classification and security controls, train employees, and leverage automated tools to streamline the process and enhance data protection measures. By adopting these best practices, CSPs can effectively safeguard sensitive data and fulfill their contractual responsibilities as trusted partners in the cloud ecosystem.

Implementation best practices for the CSP to classify and document the physical, and logical assets include (but not limited to):
a. Asset Inventory and Tracking: The CSP should leverage an inventory of all physical and logical assets that are used to store, process, or transmit CSC data (refer to DCS-06), including physical equipment, such as servers and storage devices, as well as software components, such as network assets and configurations, virtual machines, operating systems and applications
b. Asset Classification: The CSP should assess the sensitivity of data stored on each asset based on the CSC’s data classification policy. This assessment should take into account the type of CSC data, the potential harm that could be caused if the data were breached, and the legal and regulatory requirements for protecting the data
c. Automated Tools for Assets Classification: The CSP can use automated tools to help with asset classification and security. These tools can scan assets for vulnerabilities and identify assets that are not in compliance with the asset classification policies
d. Assets Classification Documentation: The CSP should document the classification of each asset and the security controls that are applied to the asset. This documentation should be made available to the CSC upon request
e. Assets Tagging: The CSPs should assign unique tags or labels to physical and logical assets to facilitate identification, tracking, and management (refer to DCS-06).
f. Apply Security Controls: Appropriate classification levels should be applied to physical and logical assets and appropriate security protection and controls in accordance to the sensitivity of the data stored on, processed or transmitted by the cloud asset
g. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: The CSP should monitor and audit assets security on a regular basis or upon changes to assets to ensure that the security controls applied are effective and appropriate based on the sensitivity levels of CSC data
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
The CSC should ensure that its data is properly protected and that the CSP implements appropriate classification and security controls on its physical and logical assets based on the sensitivity of such data.

The following implementation best practices apply for the CSC:
a. Data Classification Policy: The CSC should develop a comprehensive data classification policy (refer to DSP-01 and DSP-04) that defines the different data sensitivity levels and the criteria for classifying data into those levels. The policy should be communicated to the CSP to guide their asset classification process.
b. Data Usage Patterns: Data usage patterns, such as data access frequencies, data flows, and data processing activities could be shared with the CSP. This information can help the CSP understand the context in which your data is used and make informed classification decisions over the physical and logical assets.
c. Regulatory Compliance Requirements: The CSP should be informed about applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements that apply to CSC data, such as industry standards or government regulations. This will ensure that these requirements are taken into account by the CSP when classifying assets and implementing security controls.
d. Change Management and Communication: Open communication channels should be maintained with the CSP regarding any changes to physical and logical assets handling CSC data, or any changes to the CSC’s data classification policy or usage patterns. This communication will enable the CSP to keep asset classifications and security controls aligned with the CSC’s evolving data security and protection requirements.

Datacenter Security,Assets Cataloguing and Tracking,DCS-06,"Catalogue and track all relevant physical and logical assets located
at all of the CSP's sites within a secured system.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
Both CSP and CSC have a shared responsibility to catalog and track their owned cloud assets. The responsibility of this control implementation is ""Shared Dependent"" since the CSP should enable the CSC to access the catalog of CSP assets that are used to compute and store CSC data. The CSC should be empowered to retrieve the list of assets. It should be within the support of the CSP to assign descriptive metadata (tags) to assets for efficient and timely tracking, cost analysis, access control decisions, and alerting (by automation where applicable).

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should employ a comprehensive solution (e.g., CMDB) for tracking inventory and managing the physical locations of servers and other data center assets, while phasing out paper-based and manual processes. A hosted asset tracking solution for servers, switches, datacenter asset tracking, and racks usually leverages a combination of technologies, such as passive radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning system (GPS),  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and/or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with hardware roots-of-trust (HROT).

The CSP should maintain a list of assets the CSC is using (e.g., cloud storage) or has provisioned (e.g., VMs) and provide tools to the CSC to access the CMDB and help it identify and tag the assets that handle CSC data. For instance, the CSP should share information about the assets that are used to store the CSC’s data (as well as the means to access them).

This information can then be used by the CSC to catalog, tag, and track all the cloud relevant assets and services that are provided by the CSP, and to process and store CSC data (e.g., network, computational, and storage services).

An EoL (End-of-Life) tracking system for all inventoried assets should be maintained. A process should be established to gather and maintain accurate EoL information for all inventoried assets within the cloud environment (e.g., manufacturer EoL dates for hardware and software, expiration dates for software/services, patch availability timelines). 

Automated EoL notifications within the asset inventory system should be implemented to trigger proactive security measures like scheduling asset retirement, migrating workloads, or disabling vulnerable assets nearing their end-of-life. Such notifications should be communicated to the CSC in a timely manner for seamless integration into the CSC’s change management framework.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
The CSC should reach out to its CSP to understand what tools it provides (e.g., access to the cloud management plane via catalog managers and APIs) that enable the CSC to retrieve the list of cloud assets that are used to handle the CSC’s data.

The CSC should define a tagging strategy for their environment that involves creating a list of tags to categorize assets and asset owners in a catalog. A standardized naming convention is the starting point for organizing the cloud-hosted resources. The same naming conventions on tags should be consistently used across multiple CSPs (e.g., multi-cloud environment), and where possible, cloud assets should be tracked by an automated means, allowing for prompt decisions to be made according to them (e.g., access control decisions, monitoring and alerting, accounting).

Templates for defining a naming and tagging convention for tagging assets are defined by all major CSPs. The CSC may choose to adopt the CSP’s naming standards or define their own that they wish to apply to each asset type they plan to deploy as part of their cloud adoption effort.

Examples of tagging conventions and respective cloud assets types that should be cataloged and tracked are below, where applicable by cloud service model (but not limited to):
a. Asset Tags Types:
i. Environment Tag: Identifying resources belonging to different environments such as production, development, or testing
ii. Function/Application Tag: Associating resources with specific applications or services within the cloud environment
iii. Department Tag: Associating resources with specific departments in the organization
iv. Location Tag: Tagging resources based on their geographic location or data center region
v. Owner Tag: Specifying the individual or team responsible for a particular resource
vi. Release Version Tag: Version number of the software or application they are associated with
vii. Security Classification Tag:  Identifying the security classification or sensitivity level of resources
viii. Compliance/Regulatory Tag: Indicate compliance with specific regulations or standards
ix. Automation Tag: Indicate whether the asset should be selected for action by scripts, scanners or other form of automation
x. Active Tag: Designates resources currently in use for production, development, or other relevant purposes
xi. Deprecated Tag: Designates resources scheduled for retirement or no longer actively used
b. Cloud Asset Types:
i. Virtual machines (e.g., VM instances/images, OS name/version),
ii. Virtual networking (e.g., VPC networks and subnets, DNS records, IP addresses),
iii. Databases (e.g., database/SQL servers),
iv. Storage (e.g., block, file, object storage types), 
v. Applications (e.g., custom applications, container images, software licenses)

The catalog should include all device status changes (e.g., patch levels, lost/decommissioned status, and to whom the asset type is assigned, or approved for BYOD).

Cloud asset cataloging and tracking should be prioritized to include the most security-relevant or critical ones followed by the inclusion of remaining asset types that pertain to minimal or no risk.

If supported by the CSP, automated scans should be made to identify assets that are not tagged or have tagged values not aligned to CSC’s tagging rules (e.g., assets tagged or not tagged with a ‘classification level’ value).

When tagging tools are not made available from the CSP, the CSC should proceed with manually tagging and cataloging assets. Easy-to-parse formats (JSON, YAML, XML) should be preferred for more efficient management and maintenance of the catalog.

The CSC should map security tools to the assets included in the catalog in order to prevent, detect, recover, and respond to security risks that are applicable to them (e.g., use vulnerabilities patching and antivirus tools with VM/OS assets as preventive and detective security controls).

Assets that have been tagged with a ‘Security Classification Level’ key type should inherit the highest data classification level (high-water mark) value among the different classification levels of data that the particular asset type is destined to use for performing computational, network or storage operations on such data.

Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management,Secure Disposal,DSP-02,"Apply industry accepted methods for the secure disposal of data from
storage media such that data is not recoverable by any forensic means.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility for DSP-02 is Shared and both CSP and CSC need to implement it. This is due to the fact that either CSP or CSC may, depending on their unique requirements (e.g., regulation, end of life of storage media) may be required to securely dispose of data from storage media. 

This control is also Dependent since the CSP is expected to have the technological capability that supports industry accepted methods of deleting data in a way that is not retrievable when requested by the CSC, or when a storage device is at the end of its lifetime and needs to be decommissioned. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
a. Data Disposal Authorization: Establish authorization procedures for data disposal requests. Only authorized personnel should be able to initiate and approve such requests
b. Restrict Access after Disposal Request: the CSP should disallow any new attempts to access data once the request for data deletion has been submitted and approved
c. Data Disposal Options: Explore various data disposal options and select the most appropriate method based on data sensitivity, media type and regulatory requirements
d. Off-Premise Transport Restriction: Data media storage should not be permitted to leave the organization’s premises nor be transported out of the CSP's datacenters without being sanitized or destroyed
e. Data Destruction: Prior to physical media disposal, all data stored on such media must be completely destroyed using industry-approved methods. Implement secure data erasure procedures to render data irretrievable from storage devices. This may include physical destruction of media (e.g., hard drives demagnetization, paper shredding, etc.), data cryptographic erasure, or software-based erasure methods
f. Cryptographic Erasure: 
i. utilize encryption to render data irretrievable, by encrypting the data and then destroying the encryption key.
ii. the CSP should make sure that key material (including but not limited to keys, seeds, initialization vectors) is deleted in a forensically sound manner
g. Data Sanitization: as part of the decommissioning process or based on requests by the CSC for data deletion, a secure logical or physical data deletion method on media should be used (including but not limited to zeroization, cross-cut shredding, degaussing, incineration, or pulverizing) based on industry accepted practices such as those specified in NIST SP 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization, or methods such as DOD 5220.22-M
h. Verification of Data Destruction: Require a systematic process for verifying the successful and complete destruction of data on decommissioned media through a documented and auditable verification mechanism
i. Certification of Equipment Disposal Vendors: Use certified data disposal vendors who adhere to recognized industry standards and provide documentation certifying the proper disposal of data
j. Disposal Record-Keeping and Auditing: Maintain detailed records of all data disposal events into a tracking system with a digital certificate of media disposition that clearly indicates whether they have been cleared, purged, or destroyed. Records should include the date, type of data, disposal methods, dates of disposal, authorized personnel involved and verification results for audit and compliance purposes
k. Disposal of Active and Back Up Data: data should be deleted from both active and backup storage media including but not limited to locations where temporary and obsolete files are stored
l. Change Management for Data Disposal: all secure data disposal processes should only be carried out using a well-defined change management approval process
m. Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations: Ensure that data disposal processes comply with all applicable data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
n. Periodic Audits and Reviews: Establish a schedule for periodic audits and reviews of data disposal processes, including both physical media disposal and data destruction, to ensure ongoing compliance and effectiveness.

Note: Active storage systems are production servers, while backup storage systems are full or incremental backups/copies of active storage systems.

Additional guidelines for the CSC include:
a. Disposal of Active and Back Up Data: the CSC should ensure that data be deleted from both, active and backup storage media
b. Cryptographic Erasure: the CSC should implement managed keys to enable crypto shredding, where available and possible
c. Contractual Agreement with the CSP: 
i. Ensure data disposal requirements are clearly articulated in contractual agreements with the CSP, ensuring they adhere to the organization's data destruction policies.
ii. the logical and physical destruction of data, commensurates with the classification of data and in line with required laws and regulations

Note: Active storage systems are production servers, while backup storage systems are full or incremental backups/copies of active storage systems.

Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management,Data Inventory,DSP-03,"Create and maintain a data inventory, at least for any sensitive
data and personal data.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control ownership and implementation responsibility is defined as “Shared (Dependent)” because both parties are responsible for performing and maintaining a data inventory. The CSP needs to maintain an inventory for the CSC’s customer data (where applicable and possible) and cloud derived data, while the CSC needs to maintain an inventory, at least, for sensitive and/or personal data.

The control is Dependent since the CSC will depend on the technical capabilities available of the CSP to perform a critical data inventory activity, known as data discovery. Also, the CSP may require access to the CSC’s sensitive or personal data in the event of responding to a legal request, including for e-discovery.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
A comprehensive inventory of data fields (henceforth known as data inventory) should be created and maintained, at least for the data that is labeled ""sensitive"" or ""personal data"" (e.g., biometric data) throughout the entire lifecycle of data. It should also include data required to respond to compliance requests.
The data inventory should:
a. explicitly identify the CSC data and CSP-derived data
b. provide visibility into the location (e.g., identification of the cloud service), volume, and context of sensitive and personal data. This can be done using methods such as data discovery or regular audits
c. cover data types including but not limited to structured (e.g., stored in databases) and unstructured (e.g. stored in files, emails) data and metadata
d. be used to identify which data is difficult to identify, export, or delete
e. detail how sensitive and personal data is used, who has access to it, who it is shared with, the geographical location it is stored, and how long it will be retained
f. track data movement as it travels within, across, or outside the organization (e.g., at third parties, business partners, vendors)
g. state how data is being protected and who is responsible for data protection within the organization
h. include a data inventory matrix as an initial master list, and an automated batch process should run daily or under certain conditions, including but not limited to system architecture changes, changes in the classification of the data, changes in the risk posture based on storage, transmission or processing of such data, or changes in laws and regulations, to update the data inventory on a regular basis

Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management,Data Classification,DSP-04,"Classify data according to its type and sensitivity level.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale for IaaS is “Shared (Independent)” since:
• The CSC has more control on IaaS, they can install any tool they wish to perform data classification and hence it is their sole responsibility for data managed on the infrastructure
• The CSP is required to classify data (e.g., cloud derived data) generated by the IaaS infrastructure. 

The control ownership for IaaS is “Independent” because the CSP and CSC can classify independently depending on the data type (e.g., The CSP may want to classify log data / cloud derived data from IaaS services, while the CSC may want to classify sensitive or personal data which it stores on IaaS infrastructure).

The control ownership for PaaS and SaaS is Shared “Dependent” because:
• The CSC has less control over the underlying infrastructure and has to depend on the CSP in order to provide tools that will classify data
• The CSP is dependent on the CSC because it needs to classify cloud-derived data based on the interaction of the CSC with cloud services

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
a. data classification and labeling of data with clear definitions and examples (e.g., Public, Internal, Restricted, Confidential) should exist. Labels should contain attributes for both security and privacy. Labeling standards such as Carnegie Mellon University: Guidelines for Data Classification and SANS Institute: Tagging Data to Prevent Data Leakage (Forming Content Repositories) should be considered
b. Asset valuation could potentially store or process data (e.g.,asset valuation ratings such as High, Medium, and Low mapped against Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Impacts such as financial, reputational, customer service, operational and regulatory) should exist. The ratings should be decided based on the label applicable to the dataset and the overall risk it represents
c. technologies that either label data automatically at various layers of the infrastructure (e.g., email gateway, endpoint) or allow an end user to specifically choose classification should be considered for implementation

Note on Item c: From a control implementation perspective, the CSP should offer Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) solutions that are able to classify and label data based on known regulations (e.g., HIPAA or PCI-DSS) or custom rules (e.g., financial or proprietary data) and perform Data Leak Prevention (DLP).

d. data and asset classification should occur before a technology asset or service is being designed and placed into production. An asset value rating should be assigned to every asset in the inventory; cloud-derived data is an exception to this recommendation
e. a RACI matrix that specifies the task of each role or individual that will act as either data owner, steward/custodian or processor should exist
f. data protection controls should be commensurate with the classification of data, its associated label, the overall value of the asset that stores or processes the data and should include but not be limited to the following: 
i. Logical Controls including but not limited to encryption of data in transit, authentication, authorization (access control and permissions), audit trails, digital rights management (DRM), DLP, outbound proxy, SSL/TLS bypass, database access management (DAM), anonymization, tokenization, and pseudonymization. Types of encryption, algorithms, key sizes, and key management should be referenced in the Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management (CEK) control domain
ii. physical controls including but not limited to the physical access controls such as locks & keys, biometrics, smart cards and mandatory dual control for opening fireproof safes & cameras
iii. environmental controls including but not limited protection against extreme temperatures, humidity, fire, and other acts of nature
iv. additional controls including but not limited to protection against acts of war (e.g., terrorism, biological or chemical warfare)
g. Data Handling should include controls for all types of data, hard copies and/or digital
h. protection of data on different types of devices including but not limited to end points, servers, mobile devices,  removable (e.g., USB drives, SD cards ) & backup media (e.g. encryption of backup tapes)
i. business continuity and disaster recovery measures that will ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data (e.g., the use of special air-gapped vaults to recover from ransomware attacks, tape off-siting, recovery from hot, warm, or cold sites, regular recovery testing

stored or transmitted where. Review data flow documentation at defined intervals,
at least annually, and after any change.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership is defined as “Shared (Independent).” Shared, because both the CSP and CSC require knowing what data is processed, stored and transmitted, and where. Independent, because the documentation can be created without dependency of the CSP on the CSC and vice-versa.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Data Flow Diagram (DFD) documentation should consist of a visual representation of the following:
a. At a minimum, it should highlight where sensitive data (e.g. data labeled as personal data, Top Secret, Secret, Restricted or Internal) is processed, stored and transmitted. 
b. Sources* (typically where a connection originates from) , destinations* (typically where a connection terminates), subjects **(users, systems/assets, or processes), and objects (systems/assets, or processes). Since subjects or objects could include technology components (aka systems or assets) where the data will either be stored, processed or transmitted, a recommended way of depicting them effectively is to maintain the balance of the detail of components shown, such that it is easily understood by most audiences, technical or non-technical (e.g., by naming the technologies in use)
c. arrows which indicate whether the communication is one way or two way
d. how data moves between sources, destinations, subjects and objects. One recommended method of depicting this is by using numbers that indicate the sequential flow of information (e.g., 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4)  and combining that with arrows indicating which specific way the data is actually flowing. It is also recommended to implement application stack maps to understand where data will reside in order to factor in geographic differences in monitoring and data capture
e. where required and necessary, additional information*** such as type of operations on the data (e.g., read vs. read/write), protocols used to transmit data (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, REST), port numbers (e.g.. 443, 80), and boundaries highlighting the isolation between internal and external networks (e.g., public internet vs backend database) should be included
f. use of wireframes to structure a journey is also a popular method used to explain data flows
g. various stages of the data lifecycle from creation, use, sharing, archival to destruction
h. DFD documentation should be reviewed and updated at least once annually or when key changes take place on where the data is stored, processed or transmitted, or if the classification of the data changes (e.g., an asset that was earlier not storing sensitive personal data, will now begin storing such data)
i. DFD should documentation be ready and completed at the system design stage of the SDLC. This approach has a higher probability of the high level design (HLD) being more comprehensive, completed, and implementable
j. where possible, the CSP and CSC should work with the systems engineering team to design a systems logical design (SLD) showing all system component servers (e.g., web, application, Windows, database, network, SAN, Internet ) and the data flows, then review with all parties involved for final design and implementation

* Examples include (but are not limited to):
• systems exposed to the entire world (i.e., exposed to 0.0.0.0) 
• systems exposed to a limited audience / number of systems (e.g., exposed to a group of beta customer devices only)
• systems exposed to business partners 
• systems exposed to 3rd parties

** Examples include (but are not limited to):
• customers
• business partners
• vendors
• 3rd parties
• the general public 

*** Typically, DFDs do not detail lower level network components like routers or switches. That said, it is possible that other components such as firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) , File Scanning & Sandboxing systems , content delivery networks (CDN), or more are part of DFDs; these should be included where required and necessary.

Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management,Data Protection by Design and Default,DSP-07,"Develop systems, products, and business practices based upon a principle
of security by design and industry best practices.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership is defined as “Shared (Dependent)”. Shared because the CSP and CSC should complete security/privacy by design activities for the products and services that they wish to implement (e.g., the CSP conducts the activity for a product or service it is going to offer, while the CSC does the same in order to offer the product or service to its own set of stakeholders - customers, business partners, employees, third parties, or the general public). 

Dependent, because both parties rely on each other for “baking in” security and privacy. The CSP, for instance, depends on the CSC's feedback as input to improving an existing product or service, so it can improve it in a later version. The CSC depends on the CSP because security and privacy by design requires security architects to propose options, with benefits, drawbacks, and costs to senior management. As such, dependency on the CSP becomes vital as the CSC may not have complete knowledge of the array of products available (e.g., either on the CSP marketplace or natively), or how to implement it in a secure manner to suit the CSC's cloud and/or hybrid ecosystem. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
a. before security- and privacy-design-activities begin, the data and asset inventory, data classification and asset valuation, and DFD documentation and HLD, at a minimum should be completed. This is recommended as a prerequisite to ensure that the security or privacy controls that are designed are commensurate with the value of the data, and the associated asset and can be executed in an efficient manner; decisions on baking in security and privacy controls are based on complete and accurate information available at hand
b. security-by-design and privacy-by-design activities should begin with examining DFD and the HLD documentation, at a minimum. Where possible and if available, Low Level Design (LLDs) should also be reviewed
c. As part of the activity, threat modeling should be conducted to envision which specific threat actors (the who, e.g., script kiddies, hacktivists, criminals, nation states) could attack a specific asset, their motives (e.g., money, political, espionage), and what specific threats (the method via which they could attack and what weaknesses they could exploit) pose to an asset's  or data's security and/or privacy. Threat modeling can be performed using approaches or frameworks such as STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, or similar. If agile methodologies such as scrum or Kanban are being used within the organization, threat modeling can be conducted by documenting evil stories or misuse cases for every user story produced during a sprint. It is also recommended to create threat modeling diagrams that visually depict the concept of trust boundaries, isolation, threats affecting each asset, and recommended countermeasures. Threats can be classified into people, process, or technology
d. post threat modeling, a comprehensive security pattern* detailing the security requirements, should be created. Security requirements should consider threats identified, potential weaknesses, regulatory requirements, and recommend countermeasures that lead to prevention, detection, response or recovery of an asset that will store, process. or transmit data. NIST's Identify, Protect, Detect, Response, and Recovery model is sometimes applied as a recommended baseline
e. security requirements should be created for all stages of the SDLC,  from feasibility study to design to build to run (operationalize) to maintenance
f. security requirements should be created for every component in the design; this includes but is not limited to all technology assets in scope of the design and network connectivity between those assets
g. security requirements should cover scenarios that involve people (e.g., user education, customer education), process (e.g., customer registration for a mobile banking app via multiple authentication methods such as face verification and a one-time code sent via email the first time) and Technology (e.g., mutual TLS for all APIs that connect to third parties)
h. security requirements some of which may also apply to privacy should include but not be limited to Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for DAM. 

Note: AAA concepts are also covered via identity and access management security requirements that cover concepts such as MFA, role based or attribute based access control (RBAC/ABAC), conditional access policies, and privileged access management (PAM)

i. application security (e.g., alignment to ASVS for web, mobile application security verification standard MASVS, OWASP Top 10 API, and OWASP Top 10 for CI/CD

Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management,Data Privacy by Design and Default,DSP-08,"Develop systems, products, and business practices based upon a principle
of privacy by design and industry best practices. Ensure that systems' privacy
settings are configured by default, according to all applicable laws and regulations.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership is defined as “Shared (Dependent).” Shared, because the CSP and CSC should complete privacy by design and default activities for the products and services that they wish to implement (e.g., the CSP will conduct the activity for a product or service it is going to offer the CSC, while the CSC will do the same in order to offer the product or service to its own set of stakeholders - customers, business partners, employees, third parties or the general public).

Dependent, because both parties rely on each other for baking in privacy (sometimes via security control guidance specific in DSP-07). The CSP, for instance, depends on the CSC’s feedback as input to improve an existing product or service, so it can be improved in a later version. The CSC depends on the CSP because privacy by design and default requires security architects to propose options, with benefits, drawbacks, and costs to senior management stakeholders. As such, dependency on CSPs becomes vital as the CSC may not have complete knowledge of the array of products available (e.g., either on the CSP’s marketplace or natively), or how the implementation can be made in a secure manner to suit the CSC's cloud and/or hybrid ecosystem. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models: 
a. Before privacy by design and default activities begin, data and asset Inventory (as per control DSP-03), data classification and asset valuation (as per DSP-04), DFD and HLD at a minimum should be completed. This is recommended, as a prerequisite, in order to ensure that the security or privacy controls are commensurate with the value of the data, and the associated asset and can be executed in an efficient manner (i.e., decisions on baking in security and privacy controls are based on complete & accurate information available at hand
b. privacy by design activities should begin with examining DFDs and the HLD at a minimum. Where possible and if available the LLD should also be reviewed
c. as part of the activity, threat modeling should be conducted to envision which specific threat actors (the who, e.g., script kiddies, hacktivists, criminals, nation states) could attack a specific asset, their motives (e.g., money, political, espionage), and what specific threats (the method via which they could attack and what weaknesses they could exploit) pose to an asset's or data's security and/or privacy. Threat modeling can be performed using approaches or frameworks such as STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, or similar. If agile methodologies such as scrum or Kanban are being used within the organization, threat modeling can be conducted by documenting evil stories or misuse cases for every user story produced during a sprint. It is also recommended to create threat modeling diagrams that visually depict the concept of trust boundaries, isolation, threats affecting each asset, and recommended countermeasures. Threats can be classified into people, process, or technology
d. post threat modeling, a comprehensive security pattern* detailing the security requirements, should be created. Security requirements should consider threats identified, potential weaknesses, regulatory requirements, and recommend controls for the Prevention, Detection, Response or Recovery of an asset that will store, process or transmit data. Note: NIST's Identify, Protect, Detect, Response, and Recover model has been applied here as a recommended baseline
e. Privacy requirements should be created for all stages of the SDLC, from feasibility study to design to build to run (operationalize) to maintenance
f. Privacy requirements should be created for every component in the design; this includes but is not limited to all technology assets in scope of the design & network connectivity between those assets
g. Privacy requirements should cover scenarios that involve People (e.g. user education, customer education), Process (e.g. how will authorized business stakeholders access data subject to privacy regulations) & Technology (e.g. All JSON Web Tokens should contain a Scope section that ensures that every operation on data requires Authentication & Authorization from the Data subject)
h. Privacy by design requirements should ensure that they align with regulatory requirements in the respective jurisdiction of the organization. 

Recommended privacy by design requirements include (but are not limited to):
i. Data Minimization, specifically during the collection of data for the purposes of ensuring alignment to privacy regulations
j. Privacy notices covering what data will be collected, how it will be used, who will have access to the data, with whom it will be shared or disclosed (including 3rd parties), how long it will be retained, how it will be protected,. From an implementation perspective, privacy notices can take the form of Pop-Ups, banners, layered notices or similar
k. Additional concepts such as Consent, Choice, Collection Limitations, Data Quality, Reliable Sources, Primary & Secondary Uses, Internal & External Disclosure
l. Data Subject Access and under what conditions it will be provided (e.g. how data subjects can access and/or export their data and how they can contact the CSP with questions or concerns around privacy)
m. Technologies that deploy Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PET) such as Non-Perturbation (e.g. Masking, Suppression, Generalisation or Pseudonymisation), Perturbation (e.g., Noise Addition or Micro Aggregation) , Cryptography (e.g. Encryption techniques such as Homomorphic, Format Preserving, Deterministic, Order-Preserving) and Privacy Models such as k-anonymity, I-diversity or similar
n. Rules around how data will be protected during Cross Border transfers should be considered based on regulatory requirements
o. The default/out-of-the-box settings should align with the applicable regional privacy regulations. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 
i. explicit consent/choice based manual opt-in, wherein the data subject should manually tick a box or perform some action to explicitly consent, should be the privacy by default option available as opposed to automatic opt-in, which then requires manual opt-out by a data subject 
• Regarding cookies, only strictly necessary ones should be auto-enabled, while additional cookies of other types should be auto-disabled. Explicit consent from the data subject should be requested in the event additional cookies (other than strictly necessary cookies) need to be enabled
• Enabled by default, graphical user interfaces (GUI) should conduct data collection (e.g., via a web form) by requesting only the absolute minimum data required (e.g., if only age range is required based on legitimate use principles, specific age should not be available in the drop down menu) aka data minimization
• by default, privacy notices (either simple or layered) should be displayed each and every time information is requested from the data subject
p. CSPs should ensure that MSAs with their respective sub-contractors or dependent parties contain the requisite data privacy clauses (e.g., data breach notification clauses such as ""The CSP should inform the CSC of a data breach within a reasonable timeframe/with immediacy as per required regulations or based on instruction from the CSC” (e.g., if the CSC is the data controller)
q. Privacy by design controls should be baked into every phase of the data lifecycle, from creation to use, sharing, archival and destruction

Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management,Data Protection Impact Assessment,DSP-09,"Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to evaluate the
origin, nature, particularity and severity of the risks upon the processing
of personal data, according to any applicable laws, regulations and industry
best practices.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership is defined as “Shared (Dependent).” Shared, because the CSC typically acts as data controller, and in most instances owns the data that it puts in the CSP’s cloud. As a Data Controller, they are obliged, depending on certain conditions (e.g., data processing activities that could potentially result in high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals) to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The CSP performs a DPIA because personal data may be sent to the cloud from the CSC. 

Dependent, because the CSC may need to assess the tools and technologies available from the CSP that can be used as measures (e.g., safeguards, security mechanisms) to mitigate risk, which is one of the stages of the DPIA before recording outcomes and providing sign offs. The CSP on the other hand is dependent on the CSC, because it takes the CSC's DPIA as input, in order to understand how the CSC processes personal data. The CSP incorporates this into its security and privacy by design and default approaches by incorporating features into products and tools that they can offer other CSCs in the future so that they can meet the commitments of their DPIAs.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) should cover the following concepts: 
a. Description of the nature of data processing activities (e.g. how will data be collected, used, stored and deleted, who will it be shared with, who will have access to it, how long it will be retained)
b. Description of the scope of the processing (e.g. nature of the data, special categories of data, volume of data that will be collected, retention periods, the extent frequency of collection, the number of data subjects involved, the duration of the processing and the geographical area covered)
c. Description of the context of data processing (e.g. the source of the data, nature of relationship with the individual or data subject, level of control that data subjects will have, prior experiences of this type of processing, issues of public concern)
d. Description of the purposes of data processing (e.g.legitimate interest,  the objective of data processing, benefits of the processing, impact on data subject)
e. Considerations on how to consult with relevant stakeholders (e.g., consultation from information security experts, seeking advice and counsel from specific individuals, groups or organizations)
f. description of compliance and proportionality measures (e.g. lawful basis, ensuring data quality & minimisation)
g. Identify & assess risks and potential impact to individuals or data subjects (e.g., likelihood - remote, possible or probable and severity - minimal, significant or catastrophic of harm and overall risk - low, medium or high). Examples of potential impacts include but are not limited to inability to exercise rights (including but not limited to privacy rights), inability to access services or opportunities, loss of control over the use of personal data, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, physical harm, re-identification of pseudonymised data; or any other significant economic or social disadvantage
h. Identify measures(e.g. safeguards, security mechanisms or any other mechanism to ensure protection of personal data) to to reduce or eliminate inherent risks and agree on a value for the residual risk (e.g. low, medium or high). Examples of risk mitigation include but are not limited to deciding not to collect certain types of data;reducing the scope of the processing;reducing retention periods;taking additional technological security measures;training staff to ensure risks are anticipated and managed; anonymising or pseudonymising data where possible;writing internal guidance or processes to avoid risks;using a different technology;putting clear data-sharing agreements into place;making changes to privacy notices;offering individuals the chance to opt out where appropriate; or implementing new systems to help individuals to exercise their rights.
i. Record outcomes and sign off on the measures & residual risks approved
j. It is recommended to use  DPIA templates to record the DPIA processes and outcomes. A recommended template from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) can be found at https://gdpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dpia-template-v1.pdf
k. The DPIA should be conducted before beginning any data processing activity. It is recommended, for instance, to conduct the DPIA, before and during the planning stages of a new project or initiative
l. DPIAs should be reviewed at least once annually OR if a change in risk is envisaged as a result of data processing
m. Where required and necessary, the advice of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) should be taken when carrying out a DPIA. DPIAs should be carried out for both, CSC Data , Service Data (or Service-Generated Data)* & Support Data**

Notes: 
It is recommended to carry out an Initial Screening Assessment (ISA) during a process such as Data Classification (at the start of a project) prior to moving on to DPIAs. This is to ensure a privacy review is conducted on how processing will work regardless, as there may be instances where a DPIA isn't deemed necessary based on there being no significant risk to data subjects, which is determined in an ISA).
* Service data can be defined as personal information that the CSP collects or generates via the provisioning of certain services or data derived via the operation of a service (e.g. user or performance data).
** Support data can be defined as data provided to the CSP by the CSC to to obtain technical support for services offered by the CSP.
","Control Ownership Rationale.

The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.  
","1. Examine procedures related to DPIA risk assessment and determine if once a requirement has been established, the organization identifies and grades the associated risks and reports and prioritizes the remediation of risks and non-compliance activities. Examine whether the DPIA process and templates align to the organization's risk methodology and taxonomy.
2. Establish whether the organization has documented the roles and responsibilities for this process.

Data Security and Privacy Lifecycle Management,Sensitive Data Transfer,DSP-10,"Define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures and technical
measures that ensure any transfer of personal or sensitive data is protected
from unauthorized access and only processed within scope as permitted by the
respective laws and regulations.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a “Shared (Independent)” control for both the CSP and CSC because both should define processes, procedures, and technical measures (strong encryption or similar techniques) for data transfer – consider data transfer within the organization and externally – to prevent unauthorized access by eavesdropping or data transfer interception.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Control implementation is not service delivery model specific (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS). Irrespective of service delivery model, the CSP is responsible for implementing technical measures for data transfer within and outside the organization.

Recommendations to the CSP are: 
a. the CSP should only store and process data in jurisdictions mandated by specific data protection laws and regulations and as specified by the data controller (CSC)
b. data transfer agreements and data processing and security terms as permitted by respective laws and regulations should be documented to detail security measures to protect against unauthorized personal or sensitive data access. Define roles and responsibilities for authorization and regulatory compliance; processor and controller responsibilities (as per regulations); processor customers responsibilities (as per regulations).
c. security measures involving transfer of personal or sensitive data to protect against unauthorized personal or sensitive data access should be documented.
d. If third party or subprocesses are involved in processing of customer's personal or sensitive data, impact assessment as related to personal data should be performed. Contracts, SLAs, and vendor internal policies should be reviewed to manage risks associated with security, availability, and confidentiality involving third parties.
e. Requirements should be specified for customers, suppliers, and third parties in contract terms to implement appropriate safeguards such as:
i. access restrictions to protect information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure (i.e., authorize its employees, contractors, and sub-processors to access customer data only as strictly necessary to comply with Instructions)
ii. take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the security measures by its employees, contractors and sub-processors to the extent applicable to their scope of performance, and to ensure that all persons authorized to process customer data are under an obligation of confidentiality
iii. use TLS to protect data when in transit between the cloud services and the CSC. Use protection of connections by unique keys, which are RSA-based 2048-bit key lengths. If an API is involved as a data transfer mechanism, mutual TLS is recommended
iv. deletion terms such as deletion by customer, return or deletion when term ends, deferred deletion Instruction
v. help ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of systems and services
vi. help restore timely access to customer data following an incident and for regular testing of effectiveness
vii. incident notification to customers promptly and without undue delay after becoming aware of a data incident, and promptly take reasonable steps to minimize harm and secure customer data
viii. ensure compliance certifications and SOC reports are obtained and maintained
ix. specify customer responsibilities, access to data, subject rights and data export, and data transfers
x. datacenter and network security 
xi. data storage, isolation and logging
xii. access control
xiii. decommissioned data assets and data assets erase policy
xiv.personnel security (i.e., conducts reasonably appropriate background checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law; execute a confidentiality agreement, and acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with company's confidentiality and privacy policies; personnel provided with security training; personnel handling customer data to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role (e.g., certifications); personnel not processing customer data without authorization)
xv. sub-processor security (i.e., conduct an audit of the security and privacy practices of sub-processors to ensure they provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to the data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide)
xvi. For personal and sensitive data transfers between the EU and non-EU, the CSP should ensure the following:
• The country where the data is being transferred to has been deemed by the EU to have adequate data protection laws
• Binding Corporate Rules are defined and established
• Standard contractual clauses are established and implemented
• Explicit consent from the individuals whose data is being transferred is obtained
• Legal obligations under the local laws of the destination country, including any requirements to disclose data to government entities are considered, reviewed and incorporated
• Suitable technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data being transferred and processed are implemented

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control applies to all service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) because the implementation of a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) program takes place at an organizational level, irrespective of cloud service model.
Establishing a program for good information and technology governance, risk management, and compliance is important for all organizations, whether operating in a service consumer or service provider role. 

This control’s implementation responsibility is “Shared” because both the CSP and the CSC each need to have their own respective Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) programs to cover their operations, products, and services, and the establishment of such a program is fully internal and unique to each organization, including the associated policies and procedures. The CSP and the CSC each independently establish their own respective policies and procedures for these functions. Because the GRC program is an organizational-level function, the Shared (Independent) ownership of this control applies irrespective of the types of cloud services provided or consumed.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Establishing robust policies and procedures for an information governance program is paramount for CSPs and CSCs in the context of cloud computing and security. 

A well-defined Risk Management Program ensures that potential threats and vulnerabilities associated with cloud services are systematically identified, assessed, and mitigated, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Organizational policies and procedures contribute to the clarity and consistency of operations, ensuring that all stakeholders, including CSCs, adhere to established standards and regulatory requirements. A policy should be mapped with the organization's governing mission as its focus and should always remain up-to-date with the direction and needs of the organization.

The implementation of an Information Security Program aids CSPs safeguarding sensitive data, as it delineates encryption standards, access controls, and incident response plans, fortifying the overall security posture. These policies collectively form the cornerstone of a resilient information governance framework, instilling confidence in both CSPs and CSC by addressing risks, ensuring compliance, and enhancing overall cloud security.

Both the CSP and CSC should have a robust governance program in place. Top leadership is ultimately responsible for ensuring the program is properly implemented. A core element of governance is that the people tasked with it should have the authority to enforce it.

The CSP and CSC each have their own business needs and requirements for policies and procedures. These should cover the main security objectives of the cloud organization, the rationale for these objectives, approvals, and the review process. Policies should also delineate roles and responsibilities within the cloud organization, stating who should do what, where, when and how. 

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: A comprehensive information governance program should be established to effectively manage and protect the organization's information assets, supporting business objectives, complying with applicable regulations. The scope of the information governance program should be defined, specifying the types of information covered, the organizational units involved, and the geographic locations where the program applies. The scope should include (but not limited to):
i. all relevant information assets, including data, documents, records, and intellectual property.
ii. the ownership and custodianship of information assets
iii. the appropriate lifecycle management for information assets, including creation, storage, access, retention, and disposal
iv. guidelines for handling sensitive information, such as personal data and protected health information (PHI)
b. Risk Management Program: A risk management framework that aligns with the organization's overall risk appetite and business objectives should be established. The ERM should:
i. Identify, assess, and prioritize cloud-related risks, including data security, privacy, compliance, and operational risks
ii. Implement appropriate risk mitigation strategies, such as data encryption, access controls, and regular security audits
iii. Continuously monitor and evaluate cloud-related risks and adapt risk mitigation strategies as needed
c. Organizational Policy Reviews: Organizational policies and procedures should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain aligned with the organization's evolving business needs and regulatory requirements.
d. Policy Exception Process: a formal policy exception process should be established that is transparent, accountable, and auditable
i. criteria for approving policy exceptions should be defined, ensuring that exceptions are granted only in emergencies and/or under well justified circumstance
ii. senior management approval should be required for all policy exceptions
iii. all policy exceptions should be documented and tracked, including the rationale for approval and the mitigating measures implemented

"Governance, Risk and Compliance",Risk Management Program,GRC-02,"Establish a formal, documented, and leadership-sponsored Enterprise
Risk Management (ERM) program that includes policies and procedures for identification,
evaluation, ownership, treatment, and acceptance of cloud security and privacy
risks.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control’s implementation responsibility is typically shared between the CSP and CSC and expected to be independently implemented by each party, since the establishment of such a program is fully internal and unique to each organization and each needs to have its own respective ERM program established to cover its operations, products, and services. 
The CSP and the CSC each independently establish their own respective policies and procedures for identification, evaluation, ownership, treatment, and acceptance of risks, including those pertaining to cloud security and privacy risks. Risk management for an organization is ultimately owned by that organization's leadership.

An ERM program, as with all Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) topics, should be implemented at the organizational level and should be independent of the type of cloud service delivery model and irrespective of the types of cloud services provided or consumed. Cloud organizations, whether operating in a cloud service consumption or cloud service provider role, need to appropriately manage risk, and to establish a formal, documented, leadership-sponsored Enterprise Risk Management program.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is the overall management of risk for an organization. The service agreement or contract defines important elements such as the scope of services, service levels, responsibilities and obligations, among others, between a CSP and a CSC. While the contract may or may not define roles and responsibilities in detail, and may not address responsibilities for risk management, an entity can never fully outsource its ultimate responsibility and accountability for risk management to an external provider. The purpose of risk management is the creation and protection of value. The risk management process involves the systematic application of policies, procedures, and practices to the activities of communicating and consulting, establishing the context and assessing, treating, monitoring, reviewing, recording, and reporting risk. Risk for the CSP should be calculated using a risk appetite framework that defines the risk capacity or the maximum amount of residual risk it will accept after controls and other measures have been put in place.

The risk management process should be an integral part of management and decision-making and integrated into the structure, operations and processes of the organization. It can be applied at strategic, operational, program, or project levels. There can be many applications of the risk management process within an organization, customized to achieve objectives and to suit the external and internal context in which they are applied. As part of the ERP program, the Information security risk management process should exist. 

The Information security risk management should also include cloud-relevant information security and data privacy risks when applicable to the organization. 

The CSP and CSP should both have information security risk management processes in place. They are advised to align to the STAR Program and other widely known cyber/cloud security frameworks and standards

If the CSP uses the services of other providers,, it should ensure information security levels to the CSC are maintained or exceeded. When the CSP provides services based on a supply chain, the CSP should provide information security objectives to suppliers, and request that each of the suppliers perform risk management activities to achieve the objectives
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.

Also, the information security risk management should include cloud-relevant information security and data privacy risk when applicable. 

When using the CSP, the CSC accepts some responsibility for certain risks, and it has the final responsibility of managing those risks (accept, mitigate, transfer). The CSC should define their risk appetite and risk tolerance to be able to manage the risk correctly. The CSC should review the CSP's documentation to be able to hold an effective risk position.
","1. Examine the policy and/or procedures related to the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program to determine whether the organization has developed a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational operations and assets, and individuals.
2. Review ERM documentation, processes, and supporting evidence to confirm if the ERM program includes provisions for cloud security and privacy risk.  
3. Examine measure(s) that evaluate(s) the organization's compliance with the risk management policy and determine if the measure(s) address(es) implementation of the policy/control requirement(s) as stipulated in the policy level. 
4. Obtain and examine supporting evidence to determine if the office or individual responsible reviews the information and, if issues were identified, if they were investigated and remediated appropriately.

"Governance, Risk and Compliance",Organizational Policy Reviews,GRC-03,"Review all relevant organizational policies and associated procedures
at least annually or when a substantial change occurs within the organization.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control applies to all service models (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) because periodical reviews of policies and procedures as with all Governance And Risk Compliance (GRC) topics, should be implemented at the Organizational level, to ensure they are still up to date, relevant and valid for the Organization, independent of the type of cloud service model.
The ownership of this control is Shared (Independent) because both the CSP and the CSC each separately need to perform periodic reviews of their organization's policies and procedures, and each organization is fully responsible for performing the reviews of its own organizational policy while having no responsibilities for the review of another organization's policies. Because the need for review of an organization's policies is an organizational-level function covering all operations, products, and services of the enterprise, the Shared (Independent) ownership of this control applies irrespective of the types of cloud services provided or consumed.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Executive or senior management approval and commitment with the information security policies is necessary to legitimize the need and acts of the information security professionals and ensure that Information security strategy is a key and relevant part of the organization strategy and expectations. 

Senior executive responsible parties (CISO, CSO or equivalent responsible) should be able to simply communicate and gain top management on the information security vision and mission to successfully implement any information security strategy or programs. Top management should understand this information in order to provide the necessary support, budgets and resources needed. Information Security policies are the foundations of security strategies and programs and the way to ensure all organizational staff are aware, onboarded and knowing what they need to do. 

Updating policies, standards and related guidance regularly is important to ensure that the guidance is still relevant to the business needs, no longer in compliance with new laws and regulations, or no longer valid for the environment and technology currently in use. It's recommended to review policies, standards and related guidance at least annually or when a substantial change occurs within the organization (e.g. new technology introduced into the organization, cybersecurity incident, major operational change, changes in legal and regulatory environment, etc.)

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control applies to all service models (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS), because following GRC-01, both should have their own security policies. Any exception to those policies will be also independent of a cloud service model. 

Managing exceptions to organizational policies, standards, procedures, and other directives is an important aspect of an organization's risk management. The CSP and the CSC each independently establish their own policies and procedures for their respective organizations as well as independently manage risk for their respective organizations, and the associated process for managing exceptions to such policies is similarly and accordingly a Shared (Independent) function.

Because organizational policy management and organizational risk management programs are organizational-level functions, the Shared (Independent) ownership of this control applies irrespective of the types of cloud services provided or consumed.

This control’s implementation responsibility is shared between the CSP and the CSC, in an independent manner. It is fully and independently the responsibility of each the CSP and the CSC to establish their own separate respective information security programs. It is neither the CSP’s responsibility to develop or implement the CSC’s information security program nor is it the CSC’s responsibility to develop or implement the CSP’s information security program.

The CSP’s ownership of this control relates to developing and implementing one or more information security programs covering the CSP’s own internal organizational units and associated assets and processes as well as covering the services offered to its CSCs and associated assets and processes. The CSP does not have responsibility to develop or implement information security programs for the CSC.

The Shared (Independent) control ownership applies to all provided service models (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) because the CSP's program should address all services offered to its CSCs.

Use of the CCM domains will ensure all relevant cloud security aspects are included within the Information Security Program and provide major alignment to STAR and other widely known cyber/cloud security frameworks and standards.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should have its own security program as recommended by industry best practices, and cover all technology, information, process, and personnel aspects. It should designate roles and responsibilities where appropriate that are aligned within their organization, and document allocation of responsibilities with the CSC and its third-party providers.. 

The CSP should use feedback and reports from the CSC to enhance its Information Security Program. It should try to cover the CSC’s needs and specific regulatory and legal requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, FedRAMP). It is key that the CSP understands that the CSC still needs assurance that contractual and regulatory obligations are being met. 

The CSP might allow the CSC to perform security assessments of the CSP’s infrastructure. The CSP could also publish its official certifications and attestations, clearly defining the scope, its conditions, and specific controls that were evaluated. STAR offers a central repository for providers to publish such documents.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC’s ownership of this control relates to developing and implementing an information security program covering the CSC’s own internal organizational units, associated cloud- and non-cloud assets, and its other stakeholders.

The Shared (Independent) control ownership applies to all consumed service models (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) because the scope of a CSC's program should cover all its assets and processes, including all those that are acquired, implemented, or otherwise associated with services from external provider, regardless of service model.

Use of the CCM domains will ensure all relevant cloud security considerations are included within the Information Security Program, and provide alignment to STAR and other widely known cyber/cloud security frameworks and standards.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models: 
The CSC should design their Information Security program taking cloud security and its risk appetite toward the CSP. The purpose of the program is to make certain the organizational data, services, processes, systems, and other cloud-related assets, activities, and operations are safe, ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, and availability in all CSC environments, including cloud. The CSC should have information security responsibility and information security responsibilities, including a detailed RACI matrix, for the cloud program to adhere to and follow the overall company security strategy and security policy. This program should include all business and security requirements, regulations, and laws that directly affect the CSC. It should understand and document agreement on allocation of responsibilities with the CSP.

The CSP bears the responsibility for fostering a security culture within its organization, safeguarding itself and its clients from both accidental and malicious activities.

A clear desk policy is a fundamental component of information security, ensuring the physical protection of sensitive data from theft. This policy mandates the secure storage of assets in designated furniture, safes, and lockers, effectively shielding sensitive information from unauthorized access. Additionally, it safeguards against overlooking, shoulder surfing, and potential malicious activity by enforcing screen locks, thereby reducing the risk of session capturing, particularly in virtualized environments.

To further enhance security, whiteboards, writable walls, and other writable surfaces, along with notebooks, post-it notes, and similar materials, should be cleared, securely shredded, or wiped clean when not in use. Mobile devices and desktops may be equipped with physical cable locks to prevent theft, while servers and sensitive equipment should be stored within secured racks or cages.

When sending documents to printers, then these documents should be retrieved promptly to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all workspaces, including physical workstations, laptops, mobile devices, and cloud-based workspaces in order to protect data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information for all employees, contractors, and third parties that leave their workspaces unattended
b. Screen Locking Mechanism:
i. Require all devices to have an automatic screen locking mechanism that activates after a defined period of inactivity (e.g., not exceeding five minutes)
ii. Require strong passwords, PIN, or biometric authentication to unlock screens (refer to IAM-02)
iii. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users to further enhance screen lock security
c. Automatic Logout:
i. Implement an automatic session logout feature after a specified period of inactivity to ensure that users are not inadvertently leaving their sessions open
ii. automatically lock remote desktop sessions when not in use, and require secure authentication for re-entry
d. Privacy Screens: Encourage or require the use of privacy screens on devices to limit the visibility of screens to individuals in close proximity
e. Clear Desk Policy: employees should maintain a clean workspace, ensuring that confidential information is not openly visible when they are away from their desks. Document covers or lockable storage cabinets for sensitive documents are advised
i. confidential documents, printouts, or notes should be not left in plain sight
ii. confidential documents should be shred or securely disposed of when no longer needed (refer to DSP-02)
f. Secure Physical Devices:
i. Lock workstations, laptops, and mobile devices when left unattended, even for short periods
ii. Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all devices
iii. Avoid storing confidential data on removable media, such as USB drives, unless encrypted
g. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite
i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures
ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained
h. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders
i. Maintenance and Reviews: Workspace policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks

Both entities may have different Remote and Home Working policies and Procedures which will link to the individual organizations standards and requirements within their policies and processes that they should achieve for their respective countries , contractual or regulatory requirements.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Remote and Home working policy should be deployed by the CSP where it permits those activities for its personnel. Remote working increases the risk and threat profile of a cloud organization as these boundaries of protection may become weakened or assets may be compromised through various means. The CSP has a responsibility to protect its core systems and its CSC's data. The policy should be defined and deployed to provide its personnel the appropriate security requirements, controls and procedures to follow while they work remotely.

Personnel should be trained and informed of risks when working remotely, as the shift to a decentralized work environment introduces various cybersecurity threats that individuals must be vigilant against. 

One prevalent risk is the increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. Additionally, the use of unsecured Wi-Fi networks in home environments poses a potential threat, as it opens avenues for unauthorized access and data interception. Remote workers should also be cautious about the security of their devices, as the loss or theft of laptops or mobile devices can lead to unauthorized access to corporate data. Furthermore, the reliance on personal devices and unsecured applications for work tasks may expose organizations to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information. 

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access, process, or store information accessed, processed or stored at remote sites and locations in the context of cloud computing and cloud security. Objective of policy is to ensure that remote employees are aware of and comply with the organization's cloud security policies and procedures
b. Secure Network Connections: Require the use of a VPN for secure and encrypted communication, with strong encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms, between remote devices and the corporate network
c. Remote Working MFA Access: Require the use of MFA for accessing corporate systems and cloud services. The use of MFA on all devices and applications to add an extra layer of security should be encouraged
d. Endpoints Protection: Require the deployment of endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware and other security threats
i. Implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Endpoint Management solutions for remote device configuration, monitoring, and security enforcement (e.g., anti-malware, device encryption, secure email, etc.) (refer to UEM domain)
ii. Educate remote workers about the risks of using public Wi-Fi and recommend the use of a VPN when connecting to public networks
iii. Provide guidelines for securing home Wi-Fi networks, including the use of strong encryption (WPA3) and changing default credentials
e. Secure Remote Desktop Solutions: Where applicable, require the use secure remote desktop solutions with strong encryption and authentication
f. Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks
g. Regular Software Updates: Enable automatic updates whenever possible and educate users on the importance of keeping software up to date
h. Remote Data Backups: Require regular backups of critical data stored on remote devices and test data restoration procedures periodically to ensure data can be recovered in case of loss or a security incident
i. Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks.
j. Secure Printing: Educate remote workers with secure printing practices, such as immediately retrieving printed documents with sensitive data

To effectively review and validate user access for least privilege and separation of duties, CSPs should implement a comprehensive approach that encompasses implementation best practices, and a risk-based frequency for such reviews:
a. Access Management and Reviews: 
i. Access management processes and records should be centralized to facilitate easier identity access review and reduce the risk of inconsistencies across different cloud systems
ii. Access reviews should be conducted for remediating obsolete, excessive or unnecessary access, to ensure that access rights adhere to roles and responsibilities, least privilege and SoD principles
iii. Access reviews should be automated, if possible, using automated tools and scripts
iv. Reviews of high-risk access configurations, such as administrator accounts and access to sensitive data should be prioritized for scheduling

Applicable to all service models:
The CSP is responsible for ensuring the SoD between the privileged roles that have administrative access to the data, the keys that are used to encrypt the data, and the logging capabilities that capture the access to the data or the keys. The CSP is also responsible to maintain separation of accounts and access permissions between the production and non-production environments to ensure the personnel with access only to the non-production accounts are not able to access the production environment using non-production accounts.

Implementation best practices for the segregation of privileged access roles include (but are not limited to):
a. Privileged Access Roles Segregation:
i. The roles and responsibilities of each privileged identity should be defined ensuring that no single identity holds excessive privileges in order to establish a separation of duties and reduce the risk of misuse
ii. Privileged roles that, if combined, create conflicting combinations of access should be explicitly identified and labeled in PAM systems
iii. The roles and permissions that grant access to non-production environments should be separated from the roles and permissions that grant access to production environments
b. Access Segregation to Different Privileged Areas:
i. Privileged and administrative functions access should be divided into distinct realms, such as administrative access, encryption/key management, configuration changes, and logging, to prevent a single identity from compromising access to all these areas simultaneously
ii. Privileged activities should be isolated within a separate environment or virtual machine, where possible
c. Access Restriction to Sensitive Data and Systems:
i. Access controls should be implemented to restrict privileged users from accessing sensitive systems and data that are not directly related to their job duties (enforce PoLP for privileged accounts)
ii. SSH keys with strong key encryption and rotation should be utilized to authenticate privileged access over SSH connections
d. Privileged Access Segregation Reviews:
i. Access roles with privileged and administrative capabilities should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure proper segregation and within reasonable frequencies specified by the CSP’s IAM policy
ii. Automated processes should be implemented to regularly review identities’ segregated privilege access permissions

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP is responsible for ensuring that the activity logs are stored and maintained preferably at a centralized location. Only read-only access should be provisioned to authorized users to prevent log tampering. If privileged access is provisioned to users, the principle of SoD should be followed, and privileged activity should be recorded and reported separately for management review. The logging system should be integrated with a SIEM solution for real-time monitoring and for sending alerts when necessary. Ability to disable the system should be subject to a “break glass” procedure, with the principle of SoD duly observed. 

Scope of access control includes general non-privileged users and all privileged users such as: cloud administrators responsible for provisioning and deprovisioning cloud infrastructure resources; security administrators  responsible for developing and implementing security policies and procedures; and system operators responsible for monitoring resource performance and availability, troubleshooting, and resolving operational issues.

Implementation best practices for a CSP to safeguard logs integrity include (but are not limited to):
a. Read-only Access Restriction: Access to logs should be restricted to read-only access at all times and to authorized identities only according to the principle of least privilege
b. Immutable Log Storage:  Immutable log storage solutions (e.g., write-once-read-many (WORM) storage) should be leveraged that prevent modification or deletion of logs once they are created to ensure that logs remain tamper-proof and provide an accurate record of system events
c. Logs Integrity Verification:
i. Data integrity verification techniques should be employed (e.g., cryptographic hash functions) and verification results monitored to identify any inconsistencies or signs of tampering
ii. Procedures should be implemented for handling any discrepancies or anomalies detected during data integrity verification
d. Controlled Read-only Access Disablement:
i. SoD should be employed for disabling read-only access to logs so that the ability to disable read-only access requires collaboration between different users or teams
ii. Identities responsible for disabling read-only access should not have the ability to also modify logs, and vice versa
iii. Access to specific tools or privileged commands that can disable read-only access to logs should be restricted
iv. A multi-step authorization process for disabling read-only access should be defined and implemented (e.g., approval and justification from multiple users)
e. Break-glass Procedures:  
i. Overriding procedures in emergency situations should be documented and implemented ensuring that only authorized personnel with the highest level of security clearance can disable read-only access
ii. For emergency situations, disabling read-only access on logs should require the approval from at least two authorized individuals
f. Logs Backup: Regular backups, and secure restoration procedures of logs should be conducted and established to ensure that they are protected in case of data loss or corruption
g. Audit Logging and Monitoring: 
i. All access attempts to logs, including read, write, and delete operations should be monitored to provide an audit trail of actions taken on logs, enabling detection of unauthorized modifications
ii. Log data should be monitored for anomalies, inconsistencies, or suspicious activity that may indicate attempts to tamper with logs

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP is responsible for ensuring that the users requesting system access are uniquely identifiable and can be directly held responsible for their actions. If the CSP permits the use of shared accounts for privileged access or functions, the system logs should capture the unique ID of the user acting on behalf of the shared account to ensure individual accountability. 

The scope of such shared accounts include the accounts for: cloud administrators responsible for provisioning and deprovisioning cloud infrastructure resources; security administrators  responsible for developing and implementing security policies and procedures; and system operators who are responsible for monitoring resource performance and availability, troubleshooting, and resolving operational issues.

Implementation guidelines to ensure user identification and association with unique IDs include (but are not limited to):
a. Unique ID Management: 
i. The collection purpose, usage, and retention of user IDs should be established, documented and aligned with the CSP's privacy and security regulations to provide users with transparent information about how their data is collected, processed, and shared
ii. Use cases for user identification and the level of sensitivity of the data being associated with user IDs should be defined
iii. Each user account should have a unique ID before any access is granted. If use of shared accounts is permitted, an up-to-date list of shared accounts and all users that can act on behalf of the shared accounts, including their unique IDs and privileges, should be maintained at all times
iv. Any use of a shared account should be traceable to a unique user ID that acted on behalf of the account
v. Automated controls should be implemented to enforce unique identifier requirements
b. Unique ID Generation: A cryptographically secure algorithm to generate unique IDs for users should be employed to prevent the possibility of collisions or reuse of IDs
c. Pseudonymous IDs: Instead of directly associating user IDs with personal data, pseudonymization techniques should be employed and implemented
d. ID Access Control: Access control measures should be implemented to restrict access to user IDs to authorized personnel, systems and processes
e. ID Encryption: All user IDs should be encrypted at rest and in transit to protect them from unauthorized access and data breaches
f. ID Mapping and Linking: A secure and auditable mechanism for mapping user IDs to personal information or other sensitive data should be implemented
g. ID Lifetime Limitations: 
i. Limits on the lifetime of user IDs should be set to prevent the accumulation of excessive personal data over time

Sensitive Data Access:  Strong authentication should be enforced at all user accounts, requiring a combination of something the user: Knows (such as a password); Has (such as a mobile device or token); Is (such as biometrics); MFA for all users should be enabled, including non-privileged users who access sensitive data
ii. Administrative Access: MFA should be enforced for all administrative access (e.g., access to cloud management consoles, virtual machines, remote access gateways, and other critical cloud infrastructure elements). If MFA cannot be implemented in a particular situation, the risk should be formally registered
iii. Remote Access: MFA should be enforced for all remote access, whether through VPNs, web applications, or mobile devices
iv. Third-Party Access: MFA should be enforced for third-party access, such as through APIs or cloud services, to protect against unauthorized access by external entities
c. Second Factor Authentication: Second factor authentication should be leveraged in addition to passwords to add an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor of:
i. Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) to allow users to generate temporary codes via SMS, email, a smartphone app synchronized with an authentication server
ii. Hardware tokens or USB keys that generate unique codes for authentication
d. Passwordless Authentication: Passwordless authentication solutions should be implemented that replace traditional passwords with secure alternatives such as phishing-resistant MFA and FIDO2-compliant security keys or biometrics

ii. Ad-hoc access requests without approvals should not be granted, with exceptions in emergency situations (e.g., resolving a security incident or recovering from a major outage) where they should be approved by senior management
iii. Two levels of approvals should be required for granting privileged entitlements (i.e., approval of the user's manager or supervisor and of the asset owner should be required)
iv. Detection mechanisms should be implemented to identify and report any access that is granted without formal approvals
v. A list of persons who are authorized to approve access types and relevant requests should be documented and maintained
vi. Access rights should be immediately revoked after the business justification for such access ceases to exist
c. Authorization Monitoring and Reviews: Authorization mechanisms should be regularly reviewed and updated. Reviews should be conducted on records of identities activity, including access requests, successful and failed login attempts, and resource usage to ensure that only authorized identities have access

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSP is responsible for policy, standards, guidelines and procedures, and transparency in communicating information related to interoperability and portability of data and associated metadata and code. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Systems interoperability is the primary concern of the CSC. The degree to which a CSP offers a service based on technology that is published or standardized  typically will increase the interoperability across cloud systems. Interoperability and portability controls aim to prepare the CSC to protect their business from failure in case of a CSP outage. This can include plans for interoperability and portability with other CSPs or a different region with the current provider.

IaaS Provider: 
The CSP should provide standardized hardware and computing resources that can interact with various disparate systems, with minimal effort, and which should strictly adhere to industry standards to maintain interoperability. The CSP should be able to support complex scenarios such as cloud brokerage, cloud bursting, hybrid clouds, multi-cloud federation, etc.

The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures and standards that enable the CSC in deploying architecture that can involve multiple CSPs, hybrid models, or moving to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to the CSC. 

PaaS Provider: 
The CSP is responsible for providing a platform on which the CSC can build its systems. The CSP provides a runtime environment and an integrated application stack. It allows developers to quickly develop and deploy custom applications on the offered platforms without the need to build the infrastructure. The CSP provides the entire infrastructure and its maintenance to its consumers.

The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures, and standards that support the CSC in developing and deploying applications that can be transferred to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes, and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to the CSC.

SaaS Provider: 
The CSP provides application capabilities over the cloud, and the CSC manages its administration and the information flowing in and out of the system. The end customer needs a browser and the majority of the administration at all the levels rests with the provider.

The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures, and standards that support the CSC in retaining data and metadata in line with their data retention standards, and recovering all data and metadata when the service ceases or when moving to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes, and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to CSCs.

o. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders
p. Maintenance and Reviews: Interoperability and portability policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC is responsible for implementing policies, procedures, processes, and standards that support interoperability and portability with data formats, development languages, design patterns, and architectural requirements for cloud deployments. To avoid vendor lock-in, interoperability and portability should factor into the vendor selection process, continuous vendor audits, and exit planning. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Portability and interoperability combine to provide compatibility of cloud solutions. They are important considerations for cloud planning because together they ensure that cloud solutions continue to operate (through interoperability) and do so unchanged (through portability). When portability and interoperability between components is not addressed, unanticipated processing failures will likely result with associated costly disruption of business.

Interoperability impacts often arise within cloud computing when changing business needs drive the need for changing a service provider. While a system may be functioning to specifications with one CSP, it may not with a new provider. Lack of insight can lead to being locked to one cloud service provider. Inevitable business decisions will result in changes over time that may lead to a change in provider (e.g., due to a need to migrate providers or platforms, desiring a different feature set, complete loss of the provider, or a legal dispute).

The CSC should review the CSP's independent audit reports and documentation during the procurement process as well as throughout the period of contractual engagement. The CSC should ensure ongoing data risk assessments are carried out in support of interoperability and portability, and that internal policies and procedures are reviewed and updated to reflect any changes. 

IaaS Customer:
Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:
a. understand how virtual machine images can be captured and ported to new CSPs that may use different virtualization technologies, e.g., Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) or Open Virtualization format (OVF)
b. identify and eliminate (or at least document) any provider-specific extensions to the virtual machine environment
c. understand what practices are in place to make sure appropriate de-provisioning of VM images occurs after an application is ported from the CSP
d. understand hardware- and platform-based dependencies that need to be identified before migration of the application/data

c. understand and document application components and modules specific to the PaaS provider, and develop application architecture with layers of abstraction to minimize direct access to proprietary modules
d. when migrating to a new platform, understand the impacts on performance and availability of the application, and how these impacts will be measured
e. understand how application testing will be completed prior to and after migration, to verify that the services or applications are operating correctly. Ensure that both provider and user responsibilities for testing are well known and documented

SaaS Customer:
Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:
a. assure the possibility of migration of backups and other copies of logs, access records, and any other pertinent information which may be required for legal and compliance reasons
b. perform regular data extractions and backups to a format that is usable without the SaaS provider. Understand whether metadata can be preserved and migrated. If possible use data escrow services.
c. store unstructured data in an established portable format such as the interoperable ZIP format for both reduced storage and transfer requirements. Aggregate files into ZIP archives to reduce complexities of moving sets of multiple files
d. ensure the storage format selected interoperates regardless of the underlying platform. Data may need to be accessible from mobile, to desktop, to mainframe
e. understand whether any custom tools being implemented will have to be redeveloped, or the new vendor can provide those tools
f. understand management, monitoring, and reporting interfaces and their integration between environments
g. assure there exists a provision for the new vendor to test and evaluate the applications before migration

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following: 
a. ensure that the CSPs expose common and/or open interfaces to access all cloud functions in their cloud service offering
b. ensure the ability to federate with different CSPs to enable higher levels of scalability
c. plan to estimate costs involved for moving data to and from a CSP 
d. understand differences in security policy or controls, key management, and data protection between CSPs to avoid open undiscovered security gaps when moving to a new provider or platform
e. assure security and privacy controls implementation effectiveness across old and new providers
f. understand differences from a legal, regulatory, compliance, and operational perspective between CSPs. If the customer data and applications have strict compliance and privacy requirements, a new cloud vendor should be evaluated for those requirements before a decision to migrate is made
g. understand how base services like monitoring, logging, and auditing would transfer over to a new vendor
h. data integrity measures should be incorporated to ensure data remains unaltered while in the cloud (e.g., use watermarks, digital signing)

The APIs should be secure by design and in accordance with standardized guidelines and protocols universally recognized to enable the CSC to use for distributed cloud deployments, and to remove data securely from the environment. 

The CSP should provide the CSC with accurate documentation and communicate planned changes and updates. Documentation should support API functionality, be updated regularly, and given to customers with new API versions. Furthermore, security issues should be considered during development and updates.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC is responsible for understanding the APIs available, their security, the interoperability of the standards, complexity that may result in vendor lock-in, and the costs associated with data transfers or recovery. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSC has various methods to interact with cloud services in the form of APIs. Important standards and technologies emerging for portability and interoperability for the CSPs (e.g., OCCI, OVF) are supported by the majority of CSPs. Different platform providers offer different cloud application frameworks, and differences exist that affect API compatibility and interoperability. 

Where the CSC relies on CSP-provided APIs to retrieve their data, the CSC is responsible for configuration in alignment with CSP guidelines (also with respect to relevant sources such as OWASP), documenting deployments, and testing data and metadata transfer and recovery capabilities during implementation and through exit planning activities.

The CSC should review the CSP’s documentation, independent audit reports, and security testing. It is responsible for monitoring resources made available by the CSP to inform customers of API outages, changes, and vulnerability alerts that may impact service or require action by the CSC. 

The CSC is responsible for ensuring that the infrastructure deployed within the cloud uses open standards, either provided by the CSP or within their deployments, to enable interoperability and portability. The CSC should ensure that the CSP exposes common and/or open interfaces to access all cloud functions.

The CSC should take into account the following guidelines for ensuring API interoperability and portability:
a. monitor the resources provided by the CSP to be aware of outages and changes that may impact the service. Where the CSC relies on the CSP’s APIs to transfer data from storage, it should test them during implementation and through business continuity or exit plan testing activities
b. applications in the cloud interoperate over the Internet and outages can be anticipated. The CSC should determine how failure in one component will impact others, and avoid stateful dependencies that may risk system data integrity when a remote component fails
c. when possible, use platform components with  standardized syntax, open APIs, and open standards (e.g., OCCI)

","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The most important way to protect sensitive data in the cloud is through encryption. Not all information used within a cloud system may qualify as confidential or fall under regulations requiring protection. The CSC should assess and classify data and avoid the additional work of encryption and key management if the nature of the data does not warrant it.

The CSC should protect its network traffic during import and export of data using encryption (both in transit and at rest) based on established industry standardized protocols (e.g., TLS, IPsec) and encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) to reduce the risk of data tampering or loss. The CSC should use TLS for all interactions with the CSP’s APIs and Management Console via HTTPS (TLS) protected endpoints, which provide server authentication. 

The CSC should take into account the following guidelines when using encryption to import/export their data:
a. encrypt data before it is placed into the cloud to ensure that it cannot be accessed inappropriately
b. not rely on an encryption algorithm or a secure network protocol (or deprecated/insecure versions) that have not undergone industry scrutiny
c. ensure the CSP’s security services adhere to the same regulatory mandates to which the CSP should conform
d. use interoperable encryption such as that available through published specifications such as ZIP or OpenPGP that directly and persistently protect data and files regardless of the platform, storage systems, or location where it resides
e. avoid losing control of encrypted data by holding the keys and avoid trusting them to third parties, even if that third party is a CSP. Only the key holders can access the data

policies and procedures for infrastructure and virtualization security. Review
and update the policies and procedures at least annually.
",CSP-Owned,CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
The responsibility for this control differs depending upon chosen cloud architecture. For IaaS this is a “Shared (Dependent)” responsibility. While the CSP provides tooling to support the VM lifecycle and policies and procedures around the infrastructure, and policies and procedures around the VMs, the governance and enforcement of such belong to the CSC. For PaaS and SaaS, the CSC is abstracted from the VM layer by consuming either a platform or an application, and all policies and procedures are a CSP-owned responsibility.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Provider: 
The CSP is responsible for creating policies and procedures around the infrastructure, virtual machines, and cloud orchestration tools that they use to deliver the service. However, it is not responsible for creating policies and procedures governing the VM instances that the CSC brings into or builds within the IaaS environment. The CSP may choose to share example policies and procedures with the CSC, or offer services to help the CSC build these policies and procedures. The CSP should provide capabilities and/or technology to enable the CSC to apply the policies and procedures – for example the ability to create network security controls to separate individual VM instances from one another – but it’s up to the CSC to create the policies and procedures to use these capabilities.

PaaS Provider:
The CSP is responsible for implementing and governing the policies and procedures relating to virtualization security. The CSC is not expected to interface with the VMs in a PaaS environment in any way other than consuming the development environment which runs on top of the VMs. Therefore, the CSP should build a policy management and enforcement framework to govern the VM lifecycle, storage, and network security of the VM environment. The policies and procedures should be reviewed at least annually, and the approach (but not necessarily the specific policy/procedure detail) may be shared with the customer via the CSP’s website, the CAIQ, and/or as part of an independent auditor’s report.

SaaS Provider:
The CSP is responsible for implementing and governing the policies and procedures relating to virtualization security. The CSC does not interface with the VMs in a SaaS environment as they are simply consuming an application. Therefore, the CSP should build a policy management and enforcement framework to govern the VM lifecycle, storage, and network security of the VM environment running below the SaaS application. The policies and procedures should be reviewed at least annually, and the approach (but not necessarily the specific policy/procedure detail) may be shared with the customer via the CSP’s website, the CAIQ, and/or as part of an independent auditor’s report.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: 
i. The scope of the infrastructure and virtualization security policies and to ensure that the policies apply to all relevant components within the cloud environment, including networks, operating systems, and virtual machines
ii. The security objectives should be well articulated and aligned with industry standards and regulatory requirements applicable to the CSP
b. Capacity and Resource Planning: Capacity planning requirements and assessments planned to ensure that resources are efficiently allocated, and scalability requirements are met
c. Network Security: Network security baselines that define acceptable physical and virtual network configurations for network devices, applications, and operating systems. Guidelines for network segmentation, access control, and traffic management should be also defined and regularly reviewed
d. OS Hardening and Base Controls: Security baseline configurations for all guest/host operating systems (OS), hypervisors, VMs (with VM lifecycle management),  including standardized hardening configurations and procedures to apply the latest security patches and updates
e. Production and Non-Production Environments: Requirements for the separation of production and non-production environments, including relevant access restrictions that are tailored to the specific risks and requirements of each environment
f. Segmentation and Segregation:
i. Network physical and/or logical segmentation and segregation requirements to isolate different customer environments (CSP, CSC and intra-tenant) and prevent unauthorized access between them
ii. Intra-tenant access requirements should be defined and access restricted to authorized users and each tenant's resources and data
g. Migration to Cloud Environments: Requirements for the establishment of secure channels for data migration to cloud environments using encryption based on secure protocols
h. Network Architecture Documentation: 
i. An up-to-date documentation of the cloud network architecture including details on network topology, device configurations, data flows and security controls
ii. Documentation that should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the network environment

ii. An up-to-date threat intelligence feed and regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing conducted to identify and remediate network security weaknesses
j. Infrastructure and Virtualization Security Metrics: Monitoring metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to infrastructure and virtualization security should be defined, such as resource utilization, network traffic patterns, and security alerts
k. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite
i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures

The CSC has the responsibility to create and govern all policies and procedures relating to VM lifecycle management and security. While the CSP may provide example policies and procedures, it is up to the CSC to interpret and adjust them to be relevant to the environment that is being deployed. Alternatively, the CSC may take existing policies and procedures and adapt these to be applicable in the IaaS environment. The CSP may offer a service capability to support the CSC with the creation of these policies and procedures. The CSC is responsible for the governance of all policies and procedures and is advised to review these on an annual basis and update them appropriately. The CSC is not responsible for policies and procedures relating to the physical and virtual infrastructure that is used to deliver the service – that is the responsibility of the CSP.

Infrastructure & Virtualization Security,Capacity and Resource Planning,IVS-02,"Plan and monitor the availability, quality, and adequate capacity
of resources in order to deliver the required system performance as determined
by the business.
",CSP-Owned,CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
The responsibility for this control is the same across all cloud architectures, and is a CSP-owned responsibility. While a CSC may demand a particular service or resource capacity, it is the responsibility of the CSP to ensure that the required system performance is delivered according to these requirements. This applies equally whether the service being delivered is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should develop and maintain a resource planning framework to assess the usage of the infrastructure, platform, or application that is being delivered to the CSC. The framework should be reviewed regularly and be used by the planning, engineering, and infrastructure teams to determine if the required growth of the service meets the CSC demands. The CSP should also maintain an internal operational level agreement (OLA) and SLA with the CSC, which may include service penalties for situations where the CSP is unable to deliver capacity and availability.

Metrics should be leveraged and monitored to establish a resources capacity planning model along with the SLAs that have been determined with the internal teams, and the SLAs that are being promised to the CSC. A regular review cycle should be adopted to ensure that the planning team is able to react swiftly to required resources capacity changes.

Implementation best practices for the CSP include (but are not limited to):
a. Resource Planning Framework:
i. The business objectives, user expectations, and performance requirements should be understood for the various cloud services
ii. Strategies should be developed for allocating resources across different cloud services, considering factors like cost optimization, performance optimization, and scalability needs
iii. Historical usage patterns, future growth projections, and peak demand scenarios should be analyzed to determine the appropriate resource capacity for each service
iv. Annual reviews of resource utilization trends and projections should be performed to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize infrastructure
b. Resource Monitoring and Alerting Systems:
i. Resource utilization metrics like CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth should be continuously tracked to identify potential bottlenecks or resource constraints
ii. Unusual VM creation times, resource spikes, or sudden changes in allocated resources should be monitored to detect unauthorized activity or resource-intensive attacks

iv. Automated alerts should be configured to notify the relevant teams when resource utilization exceeds thresholds or performance degrades significantly
c. Autoscaling and Resource Optimization Techniques: 
i. Resource optimization techniques like load balancing, virtual machine consolidation, and instance termination should be employed to maximize resource utilization and minimize idle resources
ii. Autoscaling features should be utilized to automatically adjust resource capacity in real-time based on demand fluctuations, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency
d. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:
i. Monitoring data should be analyzed to identify trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement in resource planning and optimization
ii. Resource plans and strategies should be adapted in response to changing business requirements, technological advancements, and market fluctuations

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSC should monitor SLAs to ensure that the service capacity requirements are being met. These may be standard CSP SLAs, or they may be custom SLAs that have been agreed upon during contract negotiations. 

The responsibility of delivering against these SLAs is with the CSP. There may be some cloud models where the CSP requires the CSC to deliver their own metrics to the CSP to help in the longer term service capacity planning.

Metrics should be leveraged by the CSC to monitor and ensure that the CSP is meeting the determined SLAs. A regular review cycle should be adopted to ensure that the level of service delivered by the CSP is not deteriorating outside of the determined SLAs.

The implementation best practices provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Determine if the business requirements for system performance are available.
2. Determine if evidence exists that points to planning and monitoring of the availability, quality and capacity of resources.
3. Determine if evidence exists that establishes that the plan is appropriate and adequate to meet the expectations of the business requirements established in the first guideline.

to only authenticated and authorized connections, as justified by the business.
Review these configurations at least annually, and support them by a documented
justification of all allowed services, protocols, ports, and compensating controls.
",Shared (Dependent),CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
The responsibility for this control differs depending upon the chosen service. For IaaS and PaaS, this is a “Shared (Dependent control)” – while the CSP will be responsible for communications security at the infrastructure, platform, and orchestration level, the CSC is responsible for communications security above the provisioned infrastructure/platform, or when connecting different environments together. For SaaS offerings, this is a CSP-owned control. Communications security should be a standard component of the software application provided, providing a safe environment for the CSC to interact with the SaaS offering. 

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Provider:
The CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications between the orchestration layer (cloud management platform) and the CSC, and the orchestration layer and the provisioned infrastructure. This should be enforced by the use of secure protocols (TLS/HTTPS), secure APIs, perimeter security controls, and a CSP-provisioned security monitoring capability to identify potential attack vectors. The security architecture protecting the IaaS environment should be well documented, and follow a governed change management process. The configuration and associated documentation should be regularly reviewed at least annually, in order to identify any areas for improvement, or to adapt security policies to address new attack vectors. The CSP should also provide tools (either as part of the service or via a marketplace) to the CSC to enable them to build and design their own communications security architecture, however it is the responsibility of the CSC to deploy and manage the appropriate security controls.

PaaS Provider:
The CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications across the infrastructure and the platform that is being delivered as a service to the CSC. This includes the use of secure protocols (TLS/HTTPS) and secure APIs to support the CSC in accessing the platform service, along with perimeter security controls and a monitoring function to identify any potentially malicious activity from outside of the PaaS environment. The security model should be well documented and regularly reviewed by the CSP, and the APIs with which the CSC interacts should be documented and shared externally to enable the CSC to understand how to interact with the service securely. The CSP is not responsible for the security of the applications or functions that are provisioned by the CSC, however the CSP may provide tools to support the CSC.

SaaS Provider:
The CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications through all layers of the infrastructure, up to and including the application being offered to the CSC. The CSP should deliver an environment to the CSC that protects data in motion, provides an authentication and authorization mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the environment, and implements security controls to prevent lateral movement across CSC environments. The configuration of the security model should be well documented internally with mature change management processes in place. Additionally, the CSP is advised to share an overview of the security controls with the CSC to enable it to make informed decisions around the security of the software being delivered as a service.

Implementation best practices for cloud network security include (but are not limited to):
a. Network Design Principles:
i. Principles guiding the network design, such as security, resource scalability, performance, and regulatory compliance should be well comprehended and articulated
ii. An inventory of authorized services, protocols, and ports permitted for communication between the cloud network environments should be established and maintained
iii. Network security baselines should be implemented as part of a change management framework (refer to CCC-06) that encompass parameters for network virtualization and network security configurations, as well as define normal network traffic patterns for the detection of deviations and potential threats
iv. Guidelines for network segmentation, access control, and traffic management should be defined 
b. Network Communications Monitoring:
i. Identification and analysis of network traffic should be implemented, focusing on the paths of information data flows, including its origins, destinations, and routes through sensitive network areas
ii. Network traffic monitoring and analysis tools should be implemented with capabilities for:
• Packet capture and analysis
• Flow monitoring
• Anomaly detection and behavioral analytics
• User activity tracking
iii. Monitoring tools should be integrated with SIEM systems for centralized logging and analysis of network traffic
c. Network Communications Encryption: End-to-end encryption should be implemented to secure data in transit across the network communication channels
i. Network devices should be configured to enforce strong encryption for specific protocols and ports
ii. VPN tunnels should be utilized for secure communication between isolated network segments
d. Network Communications Restriction:
i. Access controls should be defined and enforced using firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), VPNs, and IAM systems
ii. Firewalls should be deployed at key points within your cloud network architecture to act as gateways between internal and external network connections, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined security rules
iii. Firewalls should be configured with granular access control rules, including IP address ranges, protocols, and ports
iv. If the cloud environment requires publicly accessible services like web or email servers, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) should be established, acting as a buffer zone for isolating sensitive internal resources from potential external threats
e. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): Adopt a zero-trust approach to cloud network access control, assuming that no user or network device is inherently trusted until verified to dynamically enforce access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and context
f. Network Configurations Review: 
i. The inventory of allowed network services, protocols, ports, and compensating controls, and network security and access control configurations and encryption practices should be reviewed and updated at least annually
ii. The rationale for allowances should be well-justified based on business needs and risk assessments

Container-Specific Implementation Guidelines.
Network communications justified by the business should be allowed, encrypted, and require authorization. Conversely, unjustified network communications should be disallowed.

Container application-aware network monitoring tools should be leveraged for:
a. Container Network Surface: Automated determination of proper container networking surfaces, including both inbound ports and process-port bindings
b. Container Traffic Flows: Detection of traffic flows between containers and other network entities over both wire traffic and encapsulated traffic
c. Network Anomalies Detection: Detection of network anomalies, such as unexpected traffic flows within the organization’s network, port scanning, or outbound access to potentially dangerous destinations
d. Malicious Content Detection: detection of invalid or unexpected malicious processes and data introduced into the container environment
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Customer:
The CSC is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications between the components that are deployed on top of the infrastructure service. This should include designing a communications security architecture that includes the appropriate use of secure protocols to protect data in motion. The CSC should implement a security monitoring capability, either cloud-native or through integration into an existing SOC platform, to integrate logs from the IaaS workload environment and identify suspicious events. The CSC should ensure that there are appropriate network-level controls in place to prevent unwanted access or exposure to resources, and to protect workloads from both lateral movement inside the environment, and malicious attackers from outside the environment. The configuration and associated documentation around communications security should be regularly reviewed, at least annually, in order to identify areas for improvement, or to adapt security policies to address new attack vectors. Change management in the environment should be defined by a well-managed process.

PaaS Customer:
The CSC is responsible to monitor, encrypt, and restrict communications across the components on top of the platform service. This includes the adoption of secure protocols (TLS/SSL) and secure APIs to ensure encrypted or protected access to the environment. The security model relating to any applications developed on top of the platform should be well documented and regularly reviewed by the CSC, taking into consideration any changes to CSP-provided APIs or infrastructure that may impact the CSC security model.

SaaS Customer:
The CSC consumes the entire software stack as a service and as such is not responsible for any of the security controls relating to communications security or communications monitoring.

Infrastructure & Virtualization Security,OS Hardening and Base Controls,IVS-04,"Harden host and guest OS, hypervisor or infrastructure control plane
according to their respective best practices, and supported by technical controls,
as part of a security baseline.
",CSP-Owned,CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control’s implementation responsibility varies between the CSP and CSC across the three cloud service models. With regards to IaaS, there is a Shared and independent implementation responsibility between CSP and CSC for the Host and Guest OS hardening, since the CSP is responsible for the Host's hardening (OS and/or Hypervisor), and the CSC is responsible for the Guest VM and OS hardening. For PaaS and SaaS the implementation responsibility shifts to the CSP only, since the hardening of OS, hypervisor and underlying infrastructure are not part of CSC’s cloud stack and therefore the CSC has no control over their secure implementation. 

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Provider: 
The CSP is responsible for provisioning hardware to support customer virtual machines that includes: hardening and maintaining updates to hypervisors, Host operating system, firmware, and utilizing confidential computing including trustworthiness assessment rooted in hardware, as well as Trusted Execution Environments,Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) and other trusted and assured equipment, obtained through a verified and reputable supplier. The CSP is not responsible for the updates to operating systems installed above the host infrastructure.

PaaS Provider:
The CSP is responsible for all system hardening host and guest OS patching across the infrastructure plane and it should do this as per the client’s requirements or as defined by good practice, but is not responsible for application level patching.

SaaS Provider: 
The CSP is responsible for all elements of system patches, including application level requirements.

Where the CSP is responsible for the updates to host (hypervisor)/guest and other system patching, it should deploy suitable testing methods before rolling out updates. Updates should be deployed in a suitable time frame depending on contractual agreements.

Implementation best practices for cloud platforms hardening include (but are not limited to):
a. Host/Guest OS, Hypervisor, VMs, Control Plane Hardening:
i. A secure configuration baseline using industry vendors and benchmarks should be created and utilized to ensure consistency across all platforms
ii. A minimal installation should be utilized and implemented, using pre-configured secure templates according to the baseline and having only essential system services/processes enabled (i.e., unnecessary ports, protocols, and network services should be disabled or removed to reduce the attack surface)
iii. Software (OSes, Hypervisor, VMs and applications) should be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches
iv. Strong authentication (e.g., complex passwords, MFA) should be configured for accessing the hypervisor/VM/OS management interfaces
v. Security features such as firewalls, anti-malware, and system logging should be enabled
vi. Configurations should be regularly reviewed and updated against the configuration baseline to ensure only necessary features are enabled
vii. For sensitive CSC workloads:
• A dedicated, single-tenant or bare-metal hypervisor instances should be used to avoid the exploitation of possible hypervisor vulnerabilities
• Conventional virtual machines (VMs) should be replaced with confidential VMs for enhanced security
• Secure boot and virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) should be utilized for enhanced security
• Hypervisors/OSes/VMs that have been rigorously tested for security should be selected (i.e., evaluated against Common Criteria (CC) Protection Profiles (PP) and assigned an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL))

VM Lifecycle-Specific Implementation Guidelines.
a. Creation
i. Secure VM templates should be used that are pre-configured with security settings, including hardened OS configurations, patching schedules, and access controls
ii. VM images should be scanned for vulnerabilities before provisioning them to CSCs
iii. Unnecessary applications, services, and drivers should be removed from VM images to reduce the attack surface
iv. A detailed inventory of all VMs should be maintained to track their creation, deployment, and status
v. Compliance checks should be implemented to ensure VMs meet security and regulatory requirements
b. Deployment
i. Provisioning controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized deployment of VMs
ii. Network segmentation should be used to isolate VMs from each other and the rest of the network.
iii. Access controls should be implemented to restrict identities access to VMs based on the cloud IAM access control policy
iv. Monitoring and alerting systems should be implemented and configured to detect suspicious activity and potential security breaches
v. Change management process should be implemented to control and track changes made to VMs (refer to CCC domain)
c. Operation
i. Security patches and updates should be regularly applied to VMs to address vulnerabilities and prevent known exploits
ii. Vulnerability scans should be regularly conducted to identify and remediate security weaknesses
iii. Configuration management tools should be used to enforce consistent and secure configurations for VMs
iv. VMs should be continuously monitored for resource usage, security events, and potential anomalies
v. Logging and auditing of VM activity should be enabled to track changes and events.
d. Maintenance
i. Backup and recovery strategies should be implemented to protect VM data from loss or corruption
ii. Maintenance tasks on VMs should adhere to the change management process
iii. Any changes made to VMs should be tested and validated before deploying them to production
iv. Documentation of VM configurations, maintenance procedures, and security policies should be maintained
e. Decommissioning
i. VM disks should be encrypted before decommissioning to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
ii. VM disks should be securely destroyed or erased to prevent data recovery
iii. Decommissioned VMs should be removed from the inventory and tracking systems and the decommissioning process documented to ensure proper authorization
iv. Audit trails should be maintained to record the decommissioning activity and data destruction procedures

Container-Specific Implementation Guidelines.
Technical controls should aid situations when only the ports, protocols, and services necessary to meet business needs are provided. Such controls should be based on common benchmarks.

The CSP should implement anti-malware, file integrity monitoring, and logging, and utilize hardware rooted trust in confidential computing (CC) and  virtual trusted platform modules (vTPMs).

Whenever possible, organizations should use minimalistic, container-specific host operating systems with all other services and functionality disabled, and with read-only file systems and other hardening practices employed to reduce attack surfaces.

The following best practices for securing containers are also recommended:
a. Dedicated Container Host: hosts that run containers should only run containers and not other apps—such as web servers or databases—outside of containers
b. Container Host Patch Management: Hosts that run containers should be continuously scanned for vulnerabilities and updated promptly
c. Hardened Container Host: The host OS should not run unnecessary system services
d. Container Host Access: Access to the container host should be based on the need-to-know and least privilege principles
e. Container Security Monitoring: file integrity monitoring and host intrusion detection should be leveraged for containers.
f. CC Protection: Where applicable, hosts should be measured by confidential computing hardware and attested to verify trust. This enables verification that the platform on which the host depends including firmware, boot code from the CPU silicon up is measured and attested even before the OS runs.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Customer:
The CSC is responsible for hardening and maintaining updates to their deployed operating systems to reduce the attack surface. This can be accomplished through a patch management system. The CSC is not responsible for the updates and hardening of the host OS or the hypervisor. The CSC needs to provide hardened baselines to those guest operating systems by utilizing security tools such as antivirus, firewalls, monitoring, logging, confidential computing, etc. The hardening of OS for guests should align with a recognized industry standard.

PaaS Customer: 
The CSC is responsible for maintaining updates to their own applications and installed software. They also are responsible for additional security hardening controls such as monitoring, logging, and protection of the applications and the stored data those applications contain. The CSC is also responsible for maintaining and justifying authorization and access to people that need that access.

SaaS Customer: 
The CSC should confirm appropriate controls are implemented to conform to its requirements and utilize software according to risk criteria. The CSC is not responsible for updates or baselines to the service. It is advised as part of this control that CSC touch points, such as the integration provider and the endpoint devices used to access the service, are hardened and managed in line with corporate policy or an appropriate industry standard.

"
Infrastructure & Virtualization Security,Production and Non-Production Environments,IVS-05,"Separate production and non-production environments.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
Both CSP and CSC are responsible for the implementation of this control but doing so independently from one another. It is a standard best practice to separate production and non-production environments  to ensure a stable production environment that is not influenced by changes in the non-production environment, and to ensure that test data never enters into a production environment (and equally that no production data enters the non-production environment). This applies equally for both CSP and CSC whether the service being delivered is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should maintain a non-production environment that is completely separate from the production environment in order to safeguard production systems from potential threats in non-production environments. The non-production environment should be running in an architecturally similar environment which is both logically and physically separated from the production environment through the use of appropriate security controls. 

The non-production environment should be used for testing any pre-production releases, and should be exclusively used with test data instead of actual CSC/business data.

Implementation best practices for CSPs include (but are not limited to):
a. Accounts and Access Permissions Separation:
i. Distinct IAM policies should exist and implemented for each environment, strictly defining access control rules and authorization levels
ii. Access permissions should be granted based on the specific roles and tasks associated with each environment to ensure that the necessary least privileges are provided
iii. Distinct accounts for accessing and managing production and non-production environments should be created
b. Network Logical/Physical Separation:
i. Logical separation between production and non-production environments should be implemented (e.g., using Virtual networks (VNet), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and cloud Network Security Groups (NSGs))
ii. Each environment should have its own VNet, encapsulated within its own network security group (NSG) to prevent accidental or deliberate cross-environment communication
iii. Physical separation should also be considered (e.g., using separate data centers, racks, or even different physical locations)
iv. Network segmentation tools should be utilized to isolate production and non-production environments from each other (e.g., separate subnets, firewalls, and access control lists (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized traffic from traversing between the environments)
c. Sandbox Environments for Development and Testing:
i. Sandbox environments specifically designed for development and testing purposes should be created
ii. Sandboxes should be isolated from production systems to prevent accidental or malicious code deployments from affecting critical data and systems
iii. Automated testing procedures should be implemented to validate the functionality and security of non-production environments before deployment to production
d. Resource Management Separation: 
i. Separate resource management tools should be implemented for each environment to prevent accidental provisioning, configuration changes, or deletions in the wrong environment
ii. Data separation strategies should be implemented to prevent the accidental mixing of production and non-production data (e.g., use different storage solutions, data masking techniques, or implementing data segregation rules within data repositories)
iii. Different versioning systems should be used for production and non-production environments to avoid conflicts between releases and ensure that only tested and approved changes are deployed to production
iv. Different naming conventions should be adopted for resources in production and non-production environments to avoid confusion and accidental changes to the wrong environment
e. Documentation: Documentation outlining the separation policies, access controls, network configurations, and testing procedures should be developed and maintained for each of production and non-production environments
f. Updates Management: Patches and updates should be first applied in the non-production environment and after successful testing, then applied to the production environment
g. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuous monitoring and evaluation of both production and non-production environments should be implemented to ensure that are adequately secured and aligned with security standards (e.g., Monitor System logs, network traffic, vulnerability scanning, and user activity to detect suspicious behavior or potential security breaches)

b. Multi-tenant Infrastructure Isolation: Multi-Tenant environments should be physically and logically separated and isolated to prevent unauthorized access between different tenants using various segmentation techniques like network segmentation, virtual machines, containerization to create isolated compartments for each tenant
c. Network Segmentation:
i. Network segmentation should be enforced at various levels, including virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and security groups to restrict network traffic within and between tenants, and prevent unauthorized cross-tenant access
ii. Virtualized networks (VNet) should be utilized to create private, isolated networks for each tenant and to compartmentalize tenant data and applications, preventing unauthorized access from other tenant environments. Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) to enforce granular access control within each VNet.

",Shared (Dependent),CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a Shared (Dependent) control for both the IaaS and PaaS CSP and the CSC.  For the SaaS solution, it is CSP-owned.
In an IaaS service, the CSC shares responsibility with the CSP to deploy, manage, secure, and configure the networking solutions. Most networking security controls in a PaaS solution are provided by the CSP. In a SaaS service, network security controls are managed and secured for the CSC as part of a software core offering because the network infrastructure is abstracted.

Implementation Guidelines.
Network-based attacks (such as but not limited to Layer 3 DDoS, man-in-the- middle, SQL Injection, IP spoofing, malware, etc.) attempt to gain unauthorized access to network infrastructure in order to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of assets and information.

Network security controls (defense-in-depth techniques) detect and prevent attacks using advanced threat intelligence and protocol analysis, anomaly detection, indicators of compromise blocking, and signature-based methods.

The CSP should also expose security controls to the CSC so it can properly configure and manage its network security.

Vulnerabilities that exist in a physical environment also apply in a virtual environment. Configuration flaws/vulnerabilities in the applications, firewalls, or networks are vulnerable to exploits. Defense-in-depth techniques should be leveraged for both physical, logical, and administrative controls.

IaaS Provider: 
The CSP should define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures, and defense-in-depth techniques (e.g., DDoS mitigation solution, network filtering, firewalls, IDS/IPS) for protection, detection, and timely response to network-based attacks against the host infrastructure (hypervisor and operating system) and storage devices.

PaaS Provider: 
The CSP should define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures, and defense-in-depth techniques (e.g., DDoS mitigation solution, network filtering, firewalls, IDS/IPS) for protection, detection, and timely response to network-based attacks against the host infrastructure (hypervisor and operating system), storage devices, virtual machines, containers, platform-managed software including web services, database services, and analytics.

ii. Web Application Firewalls should be deployed to protect web applications from common web-based attacks and block malicious requests before they can reach the application server (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and denial-of-service [DoS] attacks)
c. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): IDS/IPS solutions should be implemented to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and identify potential intrusions or attacks (IDS passively detects anomalies, while IPS actively blocks malicious traffic)
d. Network Traffic Analysis (NTA):
i. NTA tools should be utilized to gain deeper insights into network traffic patterns and identify anomalies that may indicate malicious activities (e.g., deep packet analysis, protect DDoS attacks with traffic throttling, and blackholing)
ii. Ingress/egress traffic patterns may include media access control (MAC) spoofing, ARP poisoning attacks, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
e. Network Traffic Encryption: Sensitive data in transit should be encrypted to protect it from interception and unauthorized access using secure network protocols such as TLS/IPsec for data transmissions within the cloud and between cloud and on-premises environments
f. Network Threat Intelligence: 
i. Threat intelligence feeds should be utilized to stay informed about emerging network threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods in the cloud environment
ii. Threat intelligence should be integrated into network security systems to proactively detect and prevent cloud network attacks
g. Network Infrastructure Patching and Updates: 
i. A vulnerability management program should target be leveraged to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in the cloud network infrastructure and software/applications (refer to TVM domain)
ii. Stay up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates for cloud network infrastructure components to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers
h. Network Secure Configuration Management:
i. Secure configuration standards for cloud network resources should be enforced (e.g., virtual machines, network devices settings, and cloud-based application deployment configurations)
ii. Security settings should be enabled with strong encryption for authentication and transmission, and vendor default settings replaced (e.g., encryption keys, passwords, and SNMP community strings)
i. Vendors Diversity of Security Controls: A variety of network and system components from different vendors should be used and integrated to reduce the risk of single points of failure and vulnerabilities
j. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:
i. Auditing and logging capabilities (e.g., SIEM solution) should be implemented to track network activity, user actions, and security events from various network assets Monitor logs for anomalies, suspicious activity, and potential breaches

The implementation responsibility for this control is shared between both the CSC and the CSP, however it is expected that the control is implemented independently by each party. Both parties may have different processes, procedures and technical control measures required by contractual, regulatory, or legal factors for the protection and retention of audit logs.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CSPs should implement a strong regime of protection including physical and logical controls to ensure the protection of logs that should be in line with any legal, regulatory or contractual compliance requirements. In events where these are not applicable they should ensure good practice guidelines are followed. 

Protection of logs should ensure the forensic integrity of log files and data, such as restricting unauthorized access, monitoring and auditing log access and changes, and storing in secure environments. 

Log data should be retained for a minimum duration as defined by any legal requirements and/or contractual agreement with the CSC, that can allow for operational and legal investigations or detection of malicious activities.

Additional recommendations that aim to ensure the security and retention of audit logs include (but not limited to): 
a. Centralized Audit Logging: Audit logs should be integrated with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to facilitate centralized storing and management, and for efficient monitoring and correlation of security events

g. Alerting Rules Configuration: 
i. Monitoring rules should be developed and configured to generate alerts for specific types of security events (e.g., unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, or anomalous traffic patterns)
ii. Alerts should be based on and generated from metrics that indicate risks, events, or incidents that go beyond established or agreed thresholds (e.g., based on CSC requirements)
h. Alerting Rules Review:  Alerting rules should be evaluated and refined periodically based on security trends, threat intelligence updates, and feedback from stakeholders
i. Alerts Categorization: Alerts should be classified based on severity and type, such as high, medium, and low priority, and anomaly detection, intrusion detection, and log analysis events
j. Alerting Prioritization: A hierarchical alerting system should be implemented to prioritize and route alerts to appropriate stakeholders based on severity and impact
k. Alert Data History: Historical alert data should be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and potential gaps in monitoring coverage

Applicable to all service models:
The audit log generation mechanisms should be synchronized on all systems by using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) in order to capture the date and time stamp of each event that is recorded in the log files. if system logs are not properly synced then there will be differences in the clock settings across systems and infrastructure, the date and time stamps of the activities will not match, as they would have happened in the real time, so those logs would not be beneficial in a security incident investigation or would not be permissible as evidence.

The following guidelines should be applied:
a. Centralized Time Service: 
i. A centralized time service should be created and maintained to provide clock synchronization to all assets and systems on their bootup, start, or restart
ii. Adhere to industry standards for time synchronization, such as RFC 5905 for Network Time Protocol (NTP) to ensure compatibility and interoperability with various systems and to serve as centralized and reliable time source
b. Regular Clock Synchronization: 
i. All servers within the cloud environment should be regularly synchronized with centralized NTP servers to maintain consistency across the infrastructure
ii. A clock synchronization service should be provided that the CSC can consume to synchronize its hosted assets
c. Systems Configuration: A process should be created to ensure all assets and systems are configured to obtain the time for clock synchronization from the centralized service
d. Clock Settings Integrity: Authentication mechanisms should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with time information and to protect the integrity of the time synchronization process
e. Sync Monitoring and Alerting: 
i. Monitoring systems should be set up to detect any deviations or discrepancies in time synchronization
ii. Alerting mechanisms should be in place to notify relevant stakeholders (e.g., administrators, CSCs) of any time synchronization issues
","Control Ownership Rationale.
For the IaaS and PaaS service models the CSP has the main technical responsibility of synchronizing clocks on all hardware, while the CSC should be responsible in enforcing some technical or administrative controls related to time synchronization. For SaaS, the CSP is exclusively responsible for implementing this control.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Customer:
The CSC should configure guest operating systems to synchronize a trusted time source. It is recommended to use a time source provided by the CSP.
The CSC should enforce administrative controls requiring its technical personnel to configure time accurately in its guest OS and applications and guarantee its integrity. Unauthorized changes to time synchronization should be considered as a risk and should trigger a log event.

PaaS Customer:
The CSC should enforce administrative controls requiring its technical personnel to guarantee the integrity of time configuration. Unauthorized changes to time synchronization should be considered as a risk and should trigger a log event.

SaaS Customer:
This control’s implementation applies to the CSP only.

The following guidelines should be applied:
a. Verification of CSP’s Time Controls: Verify that the CSP has implemented centralized and reliable time sources, such as NTP servers, to maintain accurate time across the infrastructure
b. Configuration Settings: CSC systems and applications should be configured to synchronize their time with the centralized NTP servers provided by the CSP
c. Regular Time Checks: Regular time checks and synchronization routines should be implemented within CSC applications to ensure accurate and consistent timekeeping
d. Dependency Considerations: Time synchronization dependencies should be considered when designing and deploying applications, to ensure that time-sensitive operations and events are correctly coordinated
e. Documentation and Compliance: The time synchronization procedures implemented within CSC systems should be documented and compliance with any industry or regulatory standards related to timekeeping met
f. Audit Trails: Audit trails that record time-related events should be maintained to facilitate traceability and accountability in case of discrepancies or security incidents
g. Communication with CSP: Open communication with the CSP should be maintained regarding time synchronization practices in support of alignment and addressing any concerns or specific requirements
","1. Examine policy that establishes the time scale and epoch, or traceability, of time across systems.
2. Evaluate the process that ensures synchronization of time on relevant systems.

Logging and Monitoring,Encryption Monitoring and Reporting,LOG-10,"Establish and maintain a monitoring and internal reporting capability
over the operations of cryptographic, encryption and key management policies,
processes, procedures, and controls.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSP and CSC are responsible for independently implementing an internal monitoring and reporting process over cryptographic operations. Although the CSP is responsible for implementing the encryption protocol, it is the responsibility of the CSC to monitor and test proper use of cryptographic operations on their portion of their shared cloud infrastructure (refer to the CEK domain for more details on policies, processes, and controls for cryptography).

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The use of cryptography to protect sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure or tampering (while in transit or at rest) needs to be governed through a well defined set of policies, standards, and procedures (refer to CEK-01 for details). The use of encryption keys should be monitored and any deviations should be reported and handled as per the policies.

Cryptographic operations should be logged, monitored, and reported to ensure any unauthorized key usage event is escalated via security incident management process and remediated. 

The log data should be protected from unauthorized tampering by implementing various solutions that protect the file integrity.

Implementation best practices for CSPs to establish and maintain effective monitoring and internal reporting capabilities for encryption and key management include (but not limited to):

c. Baselines and Thresholds: Baselines and thresholds for normal encryption and key management operations should be established (e.g., key usage, access patterns, and error rates)
d. Alerting and Reporting Mechanisms: 
i. Alerting and reporting mechanisms should be implemented to notify security teams of activities that deviate from established baselines or exceed defined thresholds
ii. Regular reports should be generated summarizing encryption and key management activities (including trends, anomalies, and potential risks)
iii. Reports should be shared with stakeholders, including security teams, compliance officers, and CSC to foster transparency and accountability
e. Monitoring Process Review: 
i. Monitoring processes of cryptographic operations should be regularly reviewed to ensure they remain effective in detecting and addressing security threats

Shared responsibilities should become identified with the use of Key Shared Security Responsibility Indicators (KSSRI) or Key Shared Cloud Security Responsibility Indicator (KSCSRI) where possible.

Policies, procedures, and supporting systems should incorporate provisions concerning the chain of custody for forensic evidence, so that such evidence becomes legally admissible.

The CSP is responsible for establishing and following company policies, resource management, regulatory and insurance requirements set forth with regards to managing incidents or performing eDiscovery and forensics-based investigations. The CSP is not responsible for maintaining knowledge of, or carrying out forensics investigations on behalf of the CSC. Nevertheless, the CSP should collaborate with the CSC during the forensic-based investigations, specifically in cases where incidents could have originated from the CSP and third-party vendors in the supply chain.

The policies and procedures should include the phases of the IR life cycle and indicate when the CSP should engage the CSC for security incidents that affect the CSC, as well as the frequency at which the CSP is expected to provide updates during incidents.

The CSP should communicate the Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, and Cloud Forensics Policies within the organization and may publish or share the IR policy for the CSC’s awareness.

Policies should require establishing a core, qualified, and standing IR team that has the capability to assess, respond, learn, and communicate appropriately.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Incident Handling Process: Time-stamped recording of activities in the IR process is necessary for metrics, SLA’s, service recovery, and availability

iv. reference to consulted Incident classification and categorization techniques from organization-approved sources (e.g., US-CERT Federal Incident Notification Guidelines or FedRAMP Incident Communications Procedures). The CSC can obtain CSP support via the CSP’s Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT)
d. Containment: 
i. the most common containment techniques (e.g., network, filtering, routing, firewall and port rule changes to deny traffic, traffic filtering or isolation) are usually the responsibility of the CSP and can be automated with capable SIEM/SOAR, logic apps, and workbooks, unless it is a CSP-provided security group firewall which would be the CSC’s responsibility
ii. the CSP should contain the security incident by reducing or removing the attacker’s ability to continue to exploit the functionality. 
iii. the CSP should ensure that forensic evidence is not compromised and that a read-only backup or creating a snapshot should be taken (e.g., cloud block-storage snapshot)
iv. The CSP should follow guidelines on managing the chain of custody for forensic evidence collected from affected systems, devices, cloud services, applications, and personnel. These policies, procedures, and supporting systems should result in legally admissible evidence
e. Eradication: 
i. the responsibility for addressing the root cause and returning the environment to a safe state needs to be defined between the CSP and CSC, or indicate where it is shared (e.g., removing malware could be the responsibility of both the CSP and the CSC)
ii. the responsibility for closing exposures, removing or resetting credentials, performing key rotation/revocation, stopping an instance, moving to a secure resource, restricting privilege access, ensuring least privilege, need to know and need to use principles should be updated accordingly
f. Recovery:
i. restoring from backups, depending on the backup strategy if within the same CSP or another CSP, should be indicated in the policy and follow BCP or DR plans to maintain prioritized sequential restoration and recovery of resources
ii. Both the CSP and CSC will need to meet the changing needs of the scalable environment with adaptable RTO/RPO capabilities when resources delivering the services have expanded dynamically as with auto scaling groups, increased storage, and increased data consumption. 
iii. responsibilities for rebuilding systems and allocation of resources to achieve recovery, and for ensuring the security of the recovered environment will need to be defined between the CSP and CSC

j. Reporting path: which security incident types should be reported to the CSC
k. Escalation path:  the escalation path with the CSC prior to a security incident
l. Notification path: automate where possible, via a security incident management tool, or an alerting service via email. An out-of-band notification path may need to be defined. The IR policy and procedures should include notification requirements and timelines as per regulatory and legal requirements, especially “Breach Notification” requirements. Reference the Federal Incident Notification Guidelines where applicable
m. IR Plan Testing: Test the IR plan periodically, either through paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation with the participation of both the CSP and CSC as well as other relevant parties
n. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite
i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures

This control’s ownership is ""Shared (Independent)"" as the CSP and CSC independently establish their own policies and procedures for Security Incident Management. The policies and procedures should clearly define roles and responsibilities and any shared responsibilities with the use of KSSRIs or KSCSRIs throughout all phases of the Security Incident Management process, including chain of custody for forensic evidence and legal obligations between the CSP and CSC.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following: 
a. CSP-CSC Collaboration: Address personnel designated to report incidents between the CSP and CSC, the timeframes established, and agreed-upon impact and severity rating applicable to the CSC and CSP for incident management practices. This ensures that an incident categorized by the CSP or CSC does not negate or dictate the appropriate response to contain and eradicate the incident, or cause variations in the understanding of the appropriate response from either party (e.g., a personal data breach requires shorter response time than a DDoS attack), the frequency to provide reports throughout the incident lifecycle, and how the incident should be reported
b. Roles and Responsibilities: Clear roles and responsibilities of the personnel in the entire incident and event management lifecycle should be defined
c. Proactive Measures: aim to reduce IR time by including preventative measures following a defense-in-depth strategy, least privilege, need-to-know, need-to-use, and zero trust models where possible, as some defense mechanisms will be available from the CSP as part of the service or at a cost to the CSC
d. IR Automation SOAR: address automation with a Security Orchestration and Automation Response (SOAR) solution to reduce the time to alert, contain, remediate, and eradicate the incident automatically, (e.g., when a malware attack is detected, quarantine the impacted systems, then either clean them automatically, reimage them, or perform other activities as programmed in the SOAR). The CSP will need to define what automated responses can be provided to the CSC where SOAR technology is used
e. IR Containment: define roles between the CSC and CSP for containment strategy. Also, predetermined criteria informing how to contain the incident should be defined in the procedures to ensure timely and cost effective containment and management. Use of KSCSRIs may assist with ensuring CSP and CSC have awareness of their containment responsibilities
f. Evidence Cloud Storage: consider the use of either a separate cloud account or of another CSP for storage of evidence. The CSP will need to inform the CSC how to accomplish this
g. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite
i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures
ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained
h. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders
i. Maintenance and Reviews: Policies and procedures for the management of security incidents should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks

Other policy and procedural considerations for timely management of security incidents for both CSP and CSC should include agreements on:
a. IR Alerting: alerting procedures should be defined and implemented within a defined time frame based on event, severity, impact, and threat intelligence
b. IR Time: response time depending on incident severity (e.g., number of minutes/hours per severity level) as per contractual agreement or SLA
c. investigation of the time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling, the shared responsibility to produce (through secure auditing, logging, and monitoring), collect, safely store (with encryption and integrity), and transfer information or evidence related to the incident. Use of KSCSRIs may be used to assist with identifying when responsibility changes between the CSP and CSC and vice versa if another CSP will be used to store the evidence
d. RTO Metrics: recovery time frame based on RTO and SLAs. Use of KSCSRIs may assist with meeting these required time frames 
e. IR Records: chronological record of all activities during the incident lifecycle with indicators to notify, report, and communicate as per agreed time frames between the CSP and CSC

The CSP should communicate the Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, & Cloud Forensics, Service Management Policy and Procedures within the organization and may publish or share the Incident Response Policy with the CSC for awareness.

"Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, & Cloud Forensics",Incident Response Plans,SEF-03,"'Establish, document, approve, communicate, apply, evaluate and maintain
a security incident response plan, which includes but is not limited to: relevant
internal departments, impacted CSCs, and other business critical relationships
(such as supply-chain) that may be impacted.'
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
Incident Response Plans control ownership is ""Shared (Independent)"" as both the CSP and CSC need to independently establish their own security IR plan and own the responsibility. The IR plans should clearly define roles and responsibilities and any shared responsibilities with the use of KSSRIs or KSCSRIs where possible.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The IR plan relates back to the SEF-01 implementation guidelines to ensure that corresponding policy and procedure requirements are incorporated for all phases of the IR life cycle.

The IR plan should provide a methodology that enables efficient management of security incidents for the organization’s cloud products and services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and clearly defines the relied-upon CSP’s services to achieve a coordinated response. Once the IR plan is established and documented the plan needs to be approved and communicated.

The IR plan should include the following provisions:
a. Scope: The IR plan should apply to both internal dependencies (such as IT, operations, support, and legal) and external dependencies (suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, and other third parties). The cloud services, systems, applications, users, and data that are in scope and monitored for events and incidents. Ensure the scope network and infrastructure is monitored by the CSP
b. Incident Response Team and Stakeholders: The stakeholders include customers, law enforcement who receive information about incidents and/or can be involved in incident management
c. Incident Tracking and Classification: Define the issue and tracking system used for recording the incident. Classify incidents by severity and urgency (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Major vs Minor), using threat intelligence, attack vector taxonomy Mitre ATT&CK for PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS tactics and techniques, and data classification for any data involved, the scope, and the impact of the incident.
d. Response Type and Expected Response Timeframes: The plan should indicate when a manual vs. automated response is required by the CSP or CSC, the time frames to respond by (e.g., mean time to acknowledge aka MTTA), by when the CSP or CSC is required to report an incident, who is responsible for containment of the incident, and the average expected mean time to containment (MTTC). The response may invoke subsequent IR plans such as an encryption key compromise-recovery plan for restoring cryptographic security services
e. Evidence Gathering and Handling: Steps to collect and maintain the integrity of the evidence should be provided, when and where to make copies, when to use exact replicas for analysis, the CSP’s or CSC’s responsibilities around logs, other collected evidence, storing in restricted read-only repositories, using a separate account or another CSP, hashing procedures, and chain of custody for ensuring admissibility in legal proceedings
f. Incident Lifecycle Phases and Procedures: Procedures for preparation, detection and analysis, eradication and recovery, post-mortem with continuous analysis at each phase to determine effectiveness, the CSC’s preventative measures such as IDS/IPS, and provide specificity around incidents with shared responsibilities.
g. Roles and Responsibilities: Common shared security responsibilities between the CSP and CSC in relation to incident response:
i. Client and endpoint incidents – (SaaS) shared CSC and CSP
ii. Identity and access incidents – (PaaS, SaaS) shared CSC and CSP
iii. Application Incidents – (PaaS) shared CSC and CSP
iv. Network incidents – (IaaS) shared CSC and CSP
v. Host incidents – (IaaS) shared CSC and CSP
Common non-shared responsibilities:
vi. Data classification and accountability incident – CSC
vii. Client and endpoint incidents (IaaS, PaaS) – CSC
viii. Identity and access incidents (IaaS) – CSC
ix. Application incidents (IaaS) – CSC
x. Application incidents (SaaS) – CSP
xi. Network incidents (PaaS, SaaS) – CSP
xii. Host incidents (PaaS, SaaS) - CSP
xiii. Infrastructure incidents (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) - CSP
h. Notification and Reporting: List of personnel at the CSP and CSC, third-party personnel, and distribution lists for notification. Use internal and external websites or portals where incidents and service outage information can be published and updated regularly to advise on the status of incidents that affect major services. US-CERT (required for US federal agencies and systems operated on behalf of the federal government) serves as the federal incident response center
i. Business Impact Assessment Information: The CSP and CSC should have BIA information for each asset, system, application, and associated classified data, with owners identified and the relevant internal departments, upstream/downstream interdependencies, services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and other business-critical relationships (such as supply chain) that may be impacted
j. Reference Information: Information on how to determine the applicable RPO, RTO, and MTD of a particular system or set of systems for restore from backup recovery procedures to restore affected services, logs, and data as per agreements between the CSC and CSP to maintain business continuity. Outline the criteria required to select the appropriate eradication and recovery choice, e.g., restore, rebuild, replace, redirect or remove.
k. Schedule: A schedule to review, test, evaluate, and maintain and approve the plan. Define the frequency or schedule to conduct the review, test coordination, and approve the plan. 
l. Plan Testing: Conduct a paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation where feasible with the participation of both the CSP and CSC as defined in the schedule. Evaluate and maintain/update the plan accordingly:
i. after testing the plan and with lessons learned obtained
ii. after incidents that resulted in changes to the response methodology, e.g., new attack vectors, containment strategies, false positives, false negatives, or caused a deviation from the response plan, and exposures detected from penetration testing.
iii. Timing: When services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), critical assets, applications, and classified data are either added or removed
iv. Plan Reapproval: The plan should be reapproved after all necessary changes are made
v. Change Control: The IR plan should maintain a document control section indicating when the plan was tested and the changes to the plan content with each iteration

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Incident Response plans should be tested periodically either through paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation where feasible with the participation of both CSP and CSC to verify the IRP’s effectiveness using various event scenarios.

The CSP should: 
a. validate and update all contact information and IR team members
b. validate and update the scope of the IR plan, both internal dependencies (such as IT, operations, support, and legal) and external (suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, and other third parties). The cloud services, systems, applications, users and data that are in scope and monitored for events and incidents. Ensure the scoped network and infrastructure is monitored by the CSP
c. define the scope for the IR test (e.g., an environment for the IR plan testing should include the following options, but not be limited to: a duplicate test/simulation environment, an alternate non production environment, and a third party CSP cloud service/account)
d. decide which area in the threat landscape to test the IR plan with e.g., the tactics techniques procedures (initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement). Follow an attack vector taxonomy process using the Mitre ATT&CK  for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS tactics and techniques to simulate events and activities that would result in an incident
e. schedule the IR plan test – arrange meetings with participants, the CSP, and the CSC as defined in the plan
f. conduct the paper walk through or simulation following the IR plan and all phases of the incident. Maintain a chronological log of the testing activities for metrics and indicators of successfully completing all timed activities and steps outlined in the plan
g. coordinated test, review, and update manual processes and automated incident management features, detection, alerting, playbooks, logic apps, rules, containment, eradication and recovery strategies
h. reconcile the organization's BC and DR plans with the IR plan, and address discrepancies
i. document and communicate the IR plan test results, with resulting action items that address areas that failed during the test, deviated from the response methodology, containment strategies, false positives, false negatives, or could not be executed
j. update the plan to address discrepancies and failures, and obtain reapproval of the plan

"Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, & Cloud Forensics",Event Triage Processes,SEF-06,"Define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures and technical
measures supporting business processes to triage security-related events.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility between the CSP and the CSC is typically both shared and dependent, as collaboration is necessary for effective triage of a security event. Triage is used for identifying, evaluating, prioritizing and responding to security events (and potential incidents) that impact both parties. The CSP can provide valuable insights into potential sources or root causes of the security event, while the CSC can contribute information specific to their data, configuration, applications, and user activity. This joint effort helps to identify the event’s scope and potential impact, leading to a more targeted and efficient response. 

For example, a security incident occurring in the platform layer for an IaaS infrastructure should be driven jointly by the CSC and the CSP to determine if it originated in the CSC’s environment or the CSP’s environment.
This may involve containment measures implemented by the CSP, such as isolating affected resources, while the CSC can take steps like user account suspension or data recovery, depending on the specific event.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
A fully documented and annually reviewed and approved triage management process should be in operation to ensure that all security events are investigated and evaluated in a timely manner.

The CSP should perform a triage process for all supporting infrastructure — virtual elastic compute, server operating systems, storage, and networking — but also middleware, development tools, BI services, database management systems, and applications configured for use by the CSC. The CSP should have visibility into the triage process to ensure the security incident management process is followed as contractually agreed.

Implementation best practices for security events triaging include (but not limited to):
a. Stakeholders Collaboration: 
i. Roles and responsibilities should be established for internal security teams, CSC support, and any external partners involved in incident response, as per contractual agreements
ii. A communication plan should be established for notifying relevant stakeholders, including internal teams, impacted CSCs, and regulatory bodies (if necessary)
b. Events Classification Scheme: A standardized method for classifying security events based on severity, potential impact, and urgency should be defined, to support events prioritization. A multi-tiered approach can be considered:
i. Tier 1.Low-risk events might involve automated containment and basic investigation (e.g., suspicious login attempts)
ii. Tier 2.Medium-risk events require deeper investigation and potential CSC notification (e.g., potential malware infection)
iii. Tier 3.High-risk events necessitate immediate action, full investigation, and potential regulatory reporting (e.g., confirmed data breach)
c. Standardized Playbook: A documented playbook outlining steps for each tier, should be developed, including:
i. Procedures for an initial assessment and gathering initial details about the event, including source, timeframe, and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs)
ii. Measures should be implemented for containment and to prevent further damage (e.g., isolating compromised systems or limiting user access)
iii. A thorough investigation should be conducted to determine the root cause, scope of the incident, and potential data loss (e.g., log analysis, threat intelligence feeds, and security tools)
iv. Actions should be implemented to eradicate the threat, recover affected systems, and prevent future occurrences

In addition, the CSC should adhere to the following best practice:
a. Incident Collaboration as per CSP Contractual Agreements: 
i. Contractual agreements with the CSP should clearly define the responsibilities and response timelines in case of a security incident
ii. The communication protocols outlined in the contractual agreement with the CSP for reporting security incidents to the CSP should be well understood
iii. A communication channel should be established with the CSP to share relevant information regarding security incidents promptly
iv. The CSC should have visibility into the CSP triage process to ensure the security incident management process is followed as contractually agreed
v. Guidance and assistance from the CSP's security team is encouraged in defining and implementing CSC’s triage process
","1. Verify if operational processes that help the organization to prepare for, identify, detect, protect, respond to and recover from information security incidents in a step-by-step manner exist.
2. Verify if tools that support these organizational procedures to triage security related events complement the ability of the teams to detect, review, monitor and quickly decide upon the context and the possible impact of the incident as it happens and over time.

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC and CSP should independently establish and maintain their own SSRM shared but independent policies and procedures.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The SSRM is pivotal in ensuring comprehensive and effective cybersecurity risk management. The CSC and CSP jointly engage in implementing, managing, and monitoring the cloud services. The various controls (e.g., from the CCM) should be performed by one party or the other, by both parties independently, or by both parties in a dependent manner. 

The SSRM serves as the key mechanism to:
a. comprehensively elaborate the controls necessary to implement, use, manage, and monitor the cloud services in a secure manner
b. establish and document a common agreement between the CSP and CSC about their respective responsibilities and expectations regarding the controls
c. serve as the basis for contractual service agreement and ongoing contractual management and compliance 
d. support effective ongoing control execution, management, monitoring, and assessment activities
e. facilitate rapid and effective IR and management through clear delineation of responsibilities and communication protocols
f. foster transparency regarding responsibilities and relationship expectations

Other parties engaged by the CSP or CSC may also be involved in supporting the delivery of cloud services. For example, a SaaS service provided by one CSP may involve the use of another CSP to provide underlying IaaS services. The security responsibilities of any supporting service providers in the supply chain should also be reflected in the SSRM.

Given the SSRM's critical role in supporting effective cloud security practices, the CSC and CSP should establish and maintain policies and procedures for the application of the SSRM across their respective cloud services. This ensures consistency and adequate coverage across all services. 

The specific SSRM policies and procedures needed for the CSP or CSC may be influenced by a number of factors. They should align with and augment broader organizational policies and procedures for procurement and contract management, third-party risk management, and cybersecurity risk management to adequately address the unique considerations and risks of cloud services. 

Further, the rigor and comprehensiveness of an organization's SSRM policies and procedures should be commensurate with the risks, complexity, and criticality of the cloud services it uses or provides. For example, the SSRM policies and procedures of a CSC that uses a few non-critical SaaS services do not need to be as extensive and rigorous as a CSC whose business fundamentally relies on extensive IaaS. Additionally, the CSC’s expectations for security program management will drive the scope and rigor of the SSRM policies and procedures.

The CSP’s policies and procedures should recognize and take into consideration the many CSP- and CSC-specific circumstances that may arise in their cloud service implementations. In particular, exceptions to policies and procedures should be formally managed and approved at the appropriate level of management. This guidance is particularly relevant to contractual commitments between the parties that engender potentially more risk to the CSP or CSC (e.g., compromises a small organization may need to make due to lack of negotiating leverage). 

The SSRM policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with the evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks. Updates should consider and incorporate lessons learned from the CSP's own cloud service implementations, as well as current industry standards and guidance (e.g., current CCM versions and implementation guidelines).  Additionally, if a significantly large, complex, and/or business-critical cloud services implementation is contemplated, the CSP may first want to review existing SSRM policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the anticipated risks and complexity.

The need to implement and maintain SSRM policies and procedures is the same for all cloud service models, however there may be differences in the specific procedures needed for different cloud service models or for specialized cloud services obtained (e.g., IDaaS).  For example, the SSRM procedures employed to manage an IaaS implementation may be more extensive than for a SaaS implementation given the greater responsibilities placed on the CSC under the IaaS model.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. organizational SSRM risk management objectives
b. integration and alignment of SSRM policy and procedures with procurement, legal, third-party risk management, and cyber risk management policies and procedures
c. how the SSRM is integrated and aligned with service contracts
d. roles and responsibilities for SSRM implementation across the cloud implementation lifecycle (i.e., in due diligence, contracting, implementation, management and monitoring, and service termination)
e. definition of risk levels applicable to the extent and rigor of due diligence, management, and monitoring activities and procedures
f. how the SSRM is reviewed, validated, and maintained in collaboration with the CSP over the lifecycle of a cloud service implementation (e.g., by different risk levels)
g. how exceptions to SSRM policy and/or issues and exceptions with respect to the allocation or performance of responsibilities are identified and managed
h. reporting requirements for SSRM program activities and performance
i. approval levels required for SSRM-related decisions

",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The ownership of this control is “Shared (Dependent).”  While the initial version of the SSRM is developed by the CSP for its product offering, the finalization, implementation, and management of the SSRM should be performed collaboratively.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CCM control STA-02 is the primary control whereby the SSRM for a given cloud service implementation is documented, implemented, and managed.

SSRM Documentation.  
CCM controls STA-03 and STA-04 provide input to this control in the form of SSRM guidance from the CSP to the CSC (STA-03), and the CSP and CSC working together to specifically delineate control ownership and responsibilities for all CCM controls (STA-04).  

For controls that are CSC-owned, the CSP should provide it with clear and concise guidance on expectations for the CSC's SSRM responsibilities.

For controls that are CSP-owned or “Shared (Independent),” the CSP is responsible for documenting those for which they are fully or partially responsible. This documentation is developed under control STA-03 to fully document the service offering and provide SSRM guidance to prospective CSCs. The CSP should specifically document the responsibilities of any third party it has engaged to fulfill a control responsibility. Such documentation should address, in particular, any necessary coordination between the third party, the CSC, and the CSP.

For those controls that are “Shared (Dependent),” the CSP should collaborate with the CSC to ensure that each party's responsibilities are fully documented and consistent with the delineation of responsibilities developed under STA-04.

SSRM documentation should also address or reference service level expectations, workload management, contact, escalation, supporting tools, reporting, or other information that may be necessary or helpful in managing the CSC's and CSP's respective responsibilities.

To ensure adequate coverage, all CCM controls should be addressed in the SSRM, even if specifically noted to be not applicable. Further, the delineation of responsibilities in the SSRM should be consistent with any contractual terms agreed to by the parties under STA-09, or may be incorporated directly or by reference in the contract. The CSC and CSP may defer documenting certain details of the SSRM until after the contract is executed or the service is implemented, however, the SSRM should always remain consistent with the contractual agreement.  

SSRM Implementation and Management.  
Once agreed to by the CSP and CSC, the SSRM for a given cloud service implementation guides many aspects of the ongoing relationship.  

Each party is responsible for implementing, managing, monitoring, and auditing their respective responsibilities for each CCM control as delineated in the SSRM (see STA-06). If questions or issues arise regarding control responsibility, the SSRM and contract agreement should be consulted to address and resolve any ambiguities. The CSP and CSC should review their supply chain agreement, and the associated SSRM for the services, at least annually (see STA-10). The SSRM should be updated as necessary to address any changes or clarifications in the shared security responsibilities. If an SSRM requires an update, the CSP should determine if the update is specific to a given CSC implementation, or if the SSRM for the service offering at large should be updated (see STA-03).

The CSP may choose to implement automated tools or reporting to facilitate the ongoing monitoring and management of the SSRM or the underlying service's controls.

The need for the CSP and CSC to document, implement, and maintain the SSRM for a cloud service implementation remains the same for all cloud service models. However, the specifics of each SSRM could change from implementation to implementation.

SSRM Guidance Documentation.  
The CSP should develop SSRM guidance documentation for each cloud service offering. The documentation should demonstrate the CSP's transparency to the CSC, and clearly articulate expectations for the security responsibilities expected of the CSC.  

The SSRM guidance should detail the CSP's responsibilities with respect to each control for the service offering, as well as the responsibilities that need to be undertaken by any third party in the CSP's supply chain. The guidance should be as detailed and unambiguous as possible, particularly where a control has a shared responsibility between the CSP and its supply chain.  

The SSRM guidance should also detail the CSP's expectations to be undertaken by the CSC (or, possibly, by the CSC's supply chain). The guidance should detail the controls where the CSC is expected to be fully responsible, as well as the controls where there is a shared responsibility with the CSP.  For areas of shared responsibility, the CSP should provide any expectations for how that shared responsibility will be undertaken and managed.  

The below responsibility designations should be documented for each control in the SSRM, and for each cloud service model, as:
a. CSP-Owned: The CSP is fully responsible for implementing, managing, and assessing the control
b. CSC-Owned: The CSC is fully responsible for implementing, managing, and assessing the control
c. Shared (Independent): The CSP and CSC both need to implement the control, but their implementations are independent of one another
d. Shared (Dependent): The CSP and CSC have joint responsibilities for the implementation, management, and assessment of the control

For some service offerings there may be controls where the CSP undertakes responsibility on a conditional basis or for an additional fee. For example, the CSP may offer backup services as an additional service offering. Any such contingent services or areas where SSRM responsibilities may be determined at a later time should be clear in the SSRM guidance.

The CAIQ provides a thorough and convenient means for CSPs to document the SSRM ownership of the controls for its cloud service offerings. The SSRM product offering guidance may additionally reference other control or product documentation, service level objectives, test or assessment results, compliance mappings, etc.

Providing Guidance to the CSC.  
The CSP should provide the SSRM guidance documentation to the prospective CSC. It serves as the basis for the detailed review of SSRM responsibilities between the CSP and the CSC under control STA-05. The documentation may be augmented by other product information, CSP organizational information, technical presentations, sales presentations, etc. over the sales cycle.

The SSRM guidance provided to the CSC is a key component in ensuring transparency and in avoiding later issues related to service responsibilities or contractual terms.

The CSP and CSC should independently and jointly review the SSRM documentation and guidance for each cloud service implementation. For the CSP, these reviews should include any cloud services used for delivering services to the CSC, as well as cloud services used for internal organizational purposes (e.g., cloud-based financial or HR applications).  

The SSRM guidance for the cloud service offering under STA-03 and STA-04 should provide the basis for initial review. The CSC should request joint meetings to clarify any questions the CSC may have about control implementation and responsibilities. The CSP should use this feedback to adjust and improve its cloud service SSRM guidance.

The SSRM review should focus particularly on controls designated as ""Shared (Dependent)"" in the SSRM.  Both parties should ensure that they are clear on their respective responsibilities for coordinated operations.  

The review may also include discussion of any controls offered on an optional basis by the CSP. The CSP should clearly inform the CSC of additional fees or conditions of such optional services.

The SSRM should be updated to reflect any changes warranted by the review.  As needed, the cloud service contract agreement should be updated (under control STA-10) to reflect the change. It is important that the SSRM documentation and contract agreement are aligned and consistent with each other.

which the organization is responsible for.
",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation and ongoing operation of the SSRM is a shared activity between the CSC and CSP.  

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:

SSRM Implementation. 
Once the SSRM has been agreed upon by the CSC and CSP, and a contract agreement is in place, they should begin the implementation of the control environment for the cloud service. The relevant controls should be designed in as the cloud service is built, and tested iteratively as components are put into service.  

As is documented in the SSRM, some CCM controls may be implemented independently by the CSP and CSC.  

It is important that the CSP and CSC coordinate and collaborate on the implementation of the controls that are identified as ""Shared (Dependent)"" in the SSRM. These controls may require some degree of coordination over the course of time, so it is important that the design and operation of the controls are well understood by both parties from the onset.

SSRM Operation.  
As the cloud service is in operation, the CSP and CSC are each responsible for the operation of the controls assigned to them in the SSRM. The controls identified as ""Shared (Dependent)"" are operated jointly as agreed by the parties. The ""-01"" controls for each of the  CCM domains describe the control policies and procedures that should guide control operation.

SSRM Management, Monitoring, and Audit. 
The implementation, operation, and management of the controls should be monitored on an ongoing basis. Additionally, the controls should be audited periodically by an independent audit group within the organization (i.e., a third-line function) and/or an external audit firm. Control design and operation may also be reviewed by an internal enterprise risk management group (i.e., a second-line function).  

The Audit and Assurance (A&A) domain provides guidance on control audit programs. Additionally, the CAIQ provides a sound basis for establishing an assessment regimen.

The CSP should expect to share the results of security assessments with both prospective and existing CSCs. The specific information should be agreed to in contracts. Control STA-10 describes the ongoing joint review of the SSRM and contract compliance for an existing cloud service implementation. Controls STA-08, STA-13, and STA-14 further describe ongoing review by the CSC. These reviews provide the opportunity to determine if changes to either the SSRM or contract are warranted.

"Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability",Supply Chain Inventory,STA-07,"Develop and maintain an inventory of all supply chain relationships.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control is independently implemented by the CSP and CSC.  Each party's supply chain inventory and inventory management practices are independent of the other.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should establish and maintain an inventory of all supply chain relationships. This inventory can be used to support various supply chain management activities including:
a. recurring due diligence review scheduling and coordination
b. management of contractual and legal matters (e.g., renewals, notices, disputes)
c. ongoing management of the SSRM
d. supply chain risk management program reporting to management
e. management of licenses
f. BIA for the business continuity management program
g. communication, coordination, and escalation during cybersecurity or availability incidents
h. analysis of supply chain aggregate and concentration risk

The supply chain inventory should generally track the following key information, as needed, in support of the above activities:
a. internal and supplier contacts (e.g., business owner, relationship manager, legal, technical, support services, emergency)
b. supplier risk ranking
c. general contract terms (e.g., contract duration, renewal dates, termination dates, etc.)
d. license counts or use restrictions
e. key business process support or dependency information (e.g., in support of BIA)
f. ongoing requirements and schedules for due diligence, periodic reviews, and monitoring

The CSP may choose to “risk rank” or create a risk-based classification scheme for their suppliers. Risk ranking of suppliers facilitates determining the appropriate level of effort and comprehensiveness for supplier due diligence and ongoing management and monitoring activities.  Risk ranking of suppliers also supports analyses of aggregate supply chain risk.

The CSP may implement practices for identifying, or incorporating, supply chain relationships that are established outside of normal organizational procurement practices (so-called ""shadow"" purchases of products or services).  

Maintenance of the supply chain inventory should be embedded in procurement and supplier security management procedures, and responsibilities for inventory maintenance should be clearly established. The inventory should be updated at various key points over the life cycle of the supplier relationship, including contract termination.  The inventory should be reviewed and updated, if necessary, at least annually.

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
This control is independently implemented by the CSP and CSC.  Each party's review of its own supply chain risks is independent of the other.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Supply chain risk is significant for most organizations. The assessment and management of these risks is not complete when the contract with a supplier is signed. There should be an ongoing program in place to monitor and manage supply chain risk.

The policies, procedures, and results from reviewing CSP supply chain risk will be the subject of initial due diligence reviews by the prospective CSC. The CSP should be transparent in these practices.

The CSP should implement procedures, and allocate sufficient resources with the requisite knowledge and experience, to manage and monitor their supply chain relationships to a degree and extent commensurate with criticality (reference control STA-07). 

Examples of supplier risk factors that should be assessed on a periodic basis include:
a. changes in a supplier's business posture that could pose adverse risk to the organization (e.g., financial condition, reputation, adverse news, compliance/regulatory issues, key personnel loss, business relationships, consumer complaints)
b. supplier’s financial statements, independent audit reports, pooled/shared assessments, independent control test reports, and internal scorecards and assessments
c. supplier’s adherence to service level agreements, product specifications, performance metrics, resource level/skill commitments, and quality expectations
d. Supplier's software supply chain risk management practices for ensuring software integrity, traceability, and provenance (e.g., software build practices, component management, and use of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs))
e. supplier's program and ability to manage its own suppliers and partners (fourth parties) and the risks those fourth parties may pose
f. supplier’s or fourth-party foreign-based operations and activities
g. critical dependencies on the supplier that may warrant the development of alternative solutions or exit strategies and plans

Reference controls STA-13 and STA-14 regarding the periodic review of supplier IT governance policies and procedures, and supplier security programs, respectively. Various industry references and standards are available that provide more guidance on ongoing supplier management and monitoring, and for structuring supply chain risk management programs more broadly.

On-site visits and independent audits (if provided for in the contract) may be warranted for suppliers of critical products or services.

Any concerns, contract exceptions, policy exceptions, or other risks identified in the reviews should be reported to the contract owner and other responsible management, as warranted.

In addition to assessing the ongoing risks associated with specific suppliers, It is recommended to periodically evaluate aggregate risk exposure across all suppliers. Such analyses may focus on vendor, nth-party, geographic, foreign-based, or other risk concentration factors and dependencies than span the organization's suppliers.

It is recommended that supply chain risk management activities align and be integrated with broader enterprise risk management programs.

",Shared (Dependent),Shared (Dependent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC and CSP should jointly negotiate and execute a contractual agreement that addresses the security provisions for the cloud service offering.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
a. General Contract Matters: 
i. The contract for the cloud service offering is the legally binding agreement between the CSC and CSP. It is important that the contract agreement and SSRM are consistent. An expectation established in the SSRM in the sales or due diligence phases leading up to contract may have no force or effect if not captured in the contract. In some cases the SSRM may be included as an exhibit or attachment to the contract. The CSP and CSC should both cross check that all CCM control responsibilities in the SSRM are covered and accurately reflected in the proposed contract.
ii. The contract should cover matters beyond just SSRM and security considerations, such as payment terms, limitations of liability, intellectual property rights, etc. The CSP will generally provide the initial proposed contract document, along with any exhibits and referenced provisions (e.g., service offering descriptions maintained online). The CSC may also have template provisions drafted that address its specific requirements or regulatory expectations. Attorneys (either inside counsel or outside counsel) will likely be involved in the negotiating process and review of the final document before signature. It is advisable to engage legal counsel that has prior experience with cloud service agreements and information security matters.
b. Common SSRM and Security Provisions: Depending on the cloud service model, nature and scope of the specific services involved, and the distribution of security responsibilities, the contract may address many of the CCM control domains. For example, data backup frequency, storage location, and immutability may be addressed for SaaS services or if included in the service offering for IaaS services. Backups may otherwise be the responsibility of the CSC and not specifically addressed in the contract.  

A non-exhaustive list of security provisions that should be addressed in a contract for cloud services include:
a. requirements for HR security practices, to include training and awareness, background checks, termination procedures, insider threat management, etc.
b. SLAs for availability and support response for issues of various types, to include penalties for failure to meet SLAs
c. non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions appropriate to the types and manner of information being shared
d. data protection and data privacy considerations, to include limitations on data storage locations (e.g., cross-border data transfer), environment segregation, CSC segregation, data access, data use, and data disposal
e. requirements for compliance with laws, regulations, standards, or other contracts (e.g., license or subcontract agreements)
f. implementation and maintenance of technical controls, such as logging and monitoring, network service protections, etc.
g. where applicable, requirements for Confidential Computing and workload isolation
h. joint maintenance and monitoring responsibilities for network connections, APIs, data transfer, and access control interfaces
i. responsibilities, communications, and restrictions related to change management
j. clauses for threat and vulnerability management and threat intelligence information exchange
k. requirements for security incident reporting, to include thresholds, minimum timeframes, and escalation paths, as well as expectations for coordination and information sharing in IR
l. maintenance of BC and DR plans by the CSP, periodic recovery plan testing, and any expectations for joint or bilateral testing with the CSC
m. requirements for physical and environmental security, to include the availability of redundant services
n. requirements for the conduct of independent assessments of the CSP's services, rights for CSC audit, and requirements for demonstrating ongoing compliance with the contract's security provisions

The CSP and CSC should establish an annual cycle of contract agreement review. This review should consider any issues, risks, or other considerations that may be raised in the ongoing reviews described for controls STA-08 (periodic review of supply chain risk factors), STA-11 (internal control assessments), STA-13 (periodic review of supplier governance policies and procedures), and STA-14 (periodic security assessments).

Any issues of contract non-compliance, inability to meet defined SLAs, or situations where either party's needs or expectations are not fully met should be discussed and resolved. Ongoing reviews provide the opportunity to maintain full transparency in the business relationship.

Reviews should also address changes in either the CSP's or CSC's services or business circumstances that could affect the ongoing relationship. For example, new products or new partnerships may be of interest to the other party.

If required, the contractual agreement should be formally renegotiated and modified to reflect any necessary changes. As warranted, the SSRM should be also updated to reflect any changes made to the contractual agreement to ensure that the two documents remain consistent.

",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
Both the CSP and CSC should perform independent internal assessments of their control implementations.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP and CSC should establish an ongoing program of internal control assessment.  

The scope and rigor of assessment programs can vary substantially based on the scope and criticality of the cloud service offering, organization size, industry, and regulatory or compliance requirements. Assessment programs may span reviews performed by the security organization (i.e., ""first-line"" program review); reviews performed by an internal, but independent risk management organization (i.e., ""second-line"" program review); and audits performed by internal audit teams or independent auditors (i.e., ""third-line"" program review). The Audit & Assurance (A&A) domain describes recommended audit program controls. The internal program assessment performed under this control should take into consideration the assessment of the CSP's supply chain performed under control STA-14 to obtain a holistic view of the control environment.

Assessment programs may involve a combination of regular, periodic manual control reviews, as well as elements that are continuous or automated in nature. Manual assessment of controls may include various inspection, sampling, and interviewing techniques. Automated controls and control reporting help ensure continuous assurance of control operation, and should be implemented wherever possible.

All controls covered by the SSRM should be included in the assessment, and all components or elements of the cloud service offering, and related activities, should be addressed. The ""-01"" CCM controls for each domain describe the control policies and procedures that should guide the assessment of control design and operating effectiveness. Review of the coverage and adequacy of the policies and procedures should be included in the assessment.

The CSP and CSC should independently implement policies and contract provisions to require that all organizations in their supply chain implement adequate security program controls related to the cloud service offering.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
All organizations involved, directly or indirectly, in implementing the SSRM controls for the cloud service offering should have sound security programs and practices in place. The CSP and CSC should each have policies in place to establish the security program and security control expectations for their suppliers, and implement those policies in contractual agreements.

Policies should consider both direct and indirect suppliers of services (i.e., third-, fourth-, and nth-party relationships). An example of an indirect relationship that should be considered is where there may be a primary supplier for datacenter infrastructure services, but that supplier outsources facility cleaning services. The background screening requirements for employees performing cleaning services (who have direct physical access to sensitive equipment and data) should be addressed.  

Both the CSP and CSC should include provisions in their supplier contracts that address the supplier's requirements for managing the security of their suppliers. Such contract provisions should address both the initial determination that supplier security programs and practices are in place and adequate (initial due diligence), and also the ongoing management and monitoring of suppliers to confirm ongoing compliance (see control STA-11).  These supplier management contract considerations should be addressed in the performance of control STA-09, where other contract-related security considerations are also addressed.

This control should be independently implemented by both the CSP and CSC.  Each party's review of the security programs of their suppliers is independent of each other.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
As a part of managing the ongoing risks of its supply chain described for control STA-08, the CSP should periodically, or on an ongoing basis, assess the security programs and controls of their suppliers.  

The policies, procedures, and results of ongoing CSP reviews of their supplier's security will, in most circumstances, be the subject of initial due diligence reviews by prospective CSCs, and ongoing due diligence reviews by existing CSC customers. The CSP should be transparent in these practices.

Where possible, the ability for a CSP to assess the security of a supplier's controls should be automated and provided as close to real-time as possible.  Control reporting, alerting mechanisms, and other such continuous control monitoring methods should be built into cloud service or other IT offerings wherever possible. Where a supplier's controls are not automated, or control operation data is not provided proactively by the supplier, periodic manual review and assessment may be required. Such reviews should generally be performed by the CSP in coordination with control STA-08.

The general objectives of the review are to determine if the supplier's security program and practices remain sufficient for the CSP's requirements, and that the supplier is complying with the expectations set forth in the SSRM and in the contract agreement. The reviews should include all direct and indirect suppliers that the CSP relies upon to provide key services (e.g., infrastructure hosting).

The following supplier security program and security control elements may be reviewed periodically by the CSP:
a. security policies, procedures, standards, and ongoing compliance with industry standards and practices
b. the supplier's risk management, risk assessment, control assessment and testing, and exception management procedures
c. documentation and testing of the specific technical controls implemented to support the product or service (e.g., identity and access management, network design and security)
d. configuration control, change management, product lifecycle, and operations policies, procedures, and controls
e. software supply chain risk management practices for ensuring software integrity, traceability, and provenance (e.g., software build practices, component management, and use of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs))
f. the supplier's own supply chain risk management policies and procedures, supplier reviews of their suppliers, and procedures employed by the supplier to manage and monitor their suppliers on an ongoing basis
g. supplier BC program plan, DR procedures, and reports of the testing of IR and recovery plans, to include any bilateral or joint testing with customers
h. threat management, logging, monitoring, and event analysis capabilities and procedures

This is a Shared (Independent) control for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS and should be implemented and operated both by the CSP and the CSC. The types of activities, events, or states for which detection tools, signatures, and indicators of compromise are defined, implemented, and evaluated will vary across each instance of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The CSP and the CSC are independently responsible for determining which such detection specifications are necessary for their respective requirements and to ensure these are adequately defined, implemented, and operated.
For SaaS implementations, CSPs will typically be responsible for this control; however, there are specific use cases where the CSC and CSP have a shared responsibility in this area.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
To maintain an effective threat detection posture, the CSP should ensure that the latest stable version of detection tools (e.g., network firewalls, WAF, NIDS, NIPS, HIDS, HIPS, network layer distributed DDoS protection, application layer DDoS protection, anti-malware software) are installed, and threats signatures and indicators of compromise (IoC) updated on a regular basis, preferably weekly or more frequently. The CSP should ensure that relevant updates are made available for the CSC to apply.

Implementation best practices for updating detection tools, threat signatures, and indicators of compromise vulnerabilities include (but are not limited to):
a. Threat Intelligence Platform: A centralized threat intelligence platform should be implemented to aggregate and curate threat data from various sources, including internal security feeds, industry reports, external threat intelligence providers, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) to provide unified access to threat indicators, signatures, and vulnerabilities
b. Threat Data Collection and Processing: The process of collecting and processing threat data from various sources should be automated (e.g., via scripts, APIs, or dedicated threat intelligence feeds) and threat data integrated into the threat intelligence platform for analysis and correlation
c. Threat Prioritization Criteria: Criteria for prioritizing threat data should be established and based on factors such as the severity of the threat, the potential impact on cloud infrastructure and CSCs data
d. Threat Signatures and Update Framework: A framework should be created for updating threat signatures for detection tools. This framework should include:
i. Continuous monitoring of threat intelligence feeds and internal security logs for new threats and IoCs
ii. Analysis of newly identified threats to determine their relevance to the CSP's cloud environment and CSC base
iii. Updates of threat signatures and IoCs based on the analysis of new threats
iv. Testing and validation of new signatures and IoCs before deployment to ensure they accurately detect threats without causing false positives
e. Detection Tools Updates: Updates for detection tools should be regularly scheduled and such tools should be configured to automatically receive updates from the vendor or threat intelligence platform (e.g., IDS/IPS tools, anti-malware software, firewalls) 
f. Version Control for Signatures and IoCs: A version control process for threat signatures and IoCs should be maintained to track changes and facilitate rollbacks if necessary. A version control system (e.g., Git) can be used to manage and store signatures and IoCs
g. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: 
i. The effectiveness of detection tools and the impact of updates on system performance and resource utilization should be continuously monitored. Metrics should be used to measure the success of the threat detection process (e.g., number of threats detected, the rate of false positives, and the time taken to respond to threats)
ii. Lessons learned from security incidents and threat analysis should be incorporated into the threat detection process
iii. Security audits and penetration testing should be regularly conducted to assess the effectiveness of the threat detection process and identify potential gaps or weaknesses. Findings should be used to refine the threat detection strategy

In addition, for SaaS implementations, CSPs will typically be responsible for this control; however, there are specific use cases where the CSC and CSP have a shared responsibility in this area.

In specific use cases, the SaaS CSC is typically responsible for determining the types of activities, events, or states for which detection tools, signatures, and indicators of compromise are desired and required and therefore need to be defined, implemented, and evaluated for a given SaaS implementation. The SaaS CSC is responsible for ensuring associated detection specifications are adequately defined, implemented, and operated. These may be accomplished in various ways, including through additional service subscription with the original CSP or through integration with the alternative services of a different third-party provider.

The CSC is, for example, often particularly responsible for defining, implementing, and evaluating processes, procedures, and technical measures to update detection tool involving appropriate application data access, data use, and data movement or exportation, and definition of appropriate or inappropriate user behavior, in relationship to their instances of the SaaS application and its associated data.

Threat & Vulnerability Management,Penetration Testing,TVM-06,"Define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures and technical
measures for the periodic performance of penetration testing by independent
third parties.
",Shared (Dependent),CSP-Owned,"Control Ownership Rationale.
This is a “Shared (Dependent)” control for IaaS and PaaS, as in both the IaaS and PaaS service models, systems, resources, and technologies can exist under the control of either the CSP or CSC where the systems, resources, and technologies are potentially subject to misconfiguration, inadequate design or implementation, or inadequate control against which the performance of such a simulated attack is desirable to determine whether the vulnerability is genuine. For IaaS and PaaS, this control specification should be implemented by each the CSP and the CSC.
For SaaS, the systems, the resources, and technologies for which a penetration test is valuable exist exclusively in the CSP layer, and the CSP is solely responsible for the implementation and operation of this control.
There can be vulnerabilities within a SaaS application configuration that can be exploited as part of a penetration test and which are the responsibility of the CSC to manage and remediate; however, those are not pen testing responsibilities addressed through this control but are vulnerability management controls addressed through a number of other TVM family controls.
When conducting penetration testing in the cloud, the shared responsibility model and what penetration testing activities are permitted by the CSP should be well understood. The service level agreement will likely define the scope of testing that is allowed and how frequently it can be done. 
Irrespective of the cloud service delivery model, the CSP is responsible for defining, implementing, and evaluating processes, procedures, and technical measures for the periodic performance of penetration testing by independent third parties.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CSPs should implement a comprehensive penetration testing strategy that encompasses the following implementation best practices:

a. PenTesting Scope: 
i. The scope of penetration testing should be defined, encompassing cloud infrastructure, applications, and data storage 
ii. Objectives for each engagement should be defined, such as identifying critical vulnerabilities, assessing the effectiveness of security controls, and validating compliance with industry standards. 
iii. Limitations or constraints should be identified, such as testing hours and potential impact on production systems
b. Authorization and Notification: 
i. Formal authorization should be obtained from senior management and ensure alignment with the cloud penetration testing policy
ii. The CSP should obtain explicit authorization from relevant stakeholders before conducting penetration testing 
iii. CSCs and relevant parties should be notified about the upcoming penetration testing to prevent unnecessary alerts or escalations
c. Third-Party Pen Testers Selection: Reputable and experienced third-party pen testers should be selected who possess expertise in cloud security and penetration testing methodologies
i. Third-party pen testers credentials, experience, and ability to handle sensitive data should be evaluated
ii. The testing firm should comply with industry standards and certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, CREST, or Offensive Security Certified Professional)
d. Engagement Procedures: Engagement procedures should be established that outline the process from planning and authorization to execution and reporting. Specify communication channels, timelines, and deliverables
e. Non-Production Environment: A non-production environment should be utilized to conduct penetration testing to minimize disruption to live services and protect sensitive data. The non-production environment should replicate the production environment to provide realistic testing scenarios
f. Data Handling and Privacy: Data anonymization techniques or sanitized data sets should be implemented and used to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information
g. PenTesting Methodology: The penetration testing engagement should be initiated by coordinating with the CSP's security team and relevant stakeholders. Industry-standard penetration testing methodologies include OWASP, NIST, or PTES
i. Thorough reconnaissance should be conducted to gather information about the cloud environment, including its architecture, configurations, and potential vulnerabilities.
ii. Open-source intelligence (OSINT), vulnerability scanners, and network mapping tools should be utilized and identified vulnerabilities analyzed to assess their severity and potential impact
iii. Proofs-of-concept (PoCs) are recommended to exploit identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate their real-world impact
iv. The findings of the penetration testing engagement should be documented to clearly outline the identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and potential impact
v. Detailed recommendations for remediation should be provided including mitigation strategies and suggested timelines
vi. A mechanism should be established to track the progress of vulnerability remediation based on the penetration testing findings
vii. The closure of reported vulnerabilities should be monitored and timely implementation of mitigation strategies ensured
viii. Follow-up penetration testing engagements should be scheduled to verify the effectiveness of remediation efforts and identify any newly introduced vulnerabilities
h. PenTesting Results Communication: The results of penetration testing should be communicated to senior management and CSCs providing insights into security enhancements and improvements
i. Continuous Improvement:
i. Cloud penetration testing processes should be periodically reviewed and updated based on evolving security threats, cloud technologies, and industry best practices. The scope, objectives, and engagement procedures should be continuously refined to ensure the program remains effective
ii. Metrics should be defined to measure the success of the cloud penetration testing program, such as the number of vulnerabilities identified, the percentage of vulnerabilities remediated, and the overall improvement in cloud security posture

There will almost certainly be limits on performing penetration tests without the permission of the CSP. The CSP and CSC should ensure that the scope of penetration tests is limited to the boundaries that each is responsible for.

Threat & Vulnerability Management,Vulnerability Prioritization,TVM-08,"Use a risk-based model for effective prioritization of vulnerability
remediation using an industry recognized framework.
",Shared (Independent),Shared (Independent),"Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility for this control is shared between both parties CSP and CSC, and both are independently responsible for implementing a risk-based model for vulnerability prioritization according to their own business needs and compliance requirements, and irrespectively of the cloud service delivery models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS). Each party, CSP and CSC is responsible for the remediation of vulnerabilities identified within the assets they own and securely manage.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Vulnerability prioritization is a critical security control for CSPs to effectively manage and mitigate security risks in cloud environments. By prioritizing vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation, CSPs can focus their resources on the most critical threats and reduce the overall attack surface of their cloud infrastructure.

For all identified vulnerabilities on the host infrastructure, network devices, virtualization technologies, operating systems, platform applications such as databases, and web applications, the CSP should use a risk-based model for effective prioritization of vulnerability remediation using an industry-recognized framework, such as but not limited to: CVSS, the OWASP risk rating methodology, etc.

Vulnerabilities should be prioritized in terms of their relative risk, importance, organizational impact, and urgency. When evaluating impact, the CSP should consider exposure levels to applicable threats from its specific usage and/or implementation. When evaluating importance, the CSP should consider the criticality and value of the affected assets. Finally, when assessing urgency, the CSP should consider the CVSS ratings and timeframes, the relevance to current and ongoing threats, and the effort required for remediation.

Implementation best practices for vulnerabilities prioritization include (but not be limited to):
a. Risk-based Vulnerabilities Prioritization: 
i. Vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to the cloud organization should be prioritized first, based on their severity, likelihood of exploitation, and potential impact
ii. A vulnerability prioritization matrix can be used to guide decision-making and ensure a consistent approach to vulnerability management
b. Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): CVSS should be integrated into the vulnerabilities management process and used for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and exploitability. With CVSS, CSPs can objectively prioritize vulnerabilities and make informed decisions about remediation efforts
c. Threat Intelligence Feeds: Threat intelligence feeds provide real-time information about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits and should be integrated into the vulnerability management processes to dynamically prioritize vulnerabilities
d. Asset Criticality: Vulnerabilities prioritization should consider the criticality of the assets affected (i.e., Assets with higher criticality, such as those that store sensitive data or support critical business functions, should be prioritized for remediation)
e. Remediation Workflows: CSPs should establish clear remediation workflows to ensure that prioritized vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively
f. Prioritization Effectiveness: The effectiveness of vulnerability prioritization strategies should be continuously measured (e.g., by tracking remediation times), to help refine prioritization criteria and improve overall security effectiveness
g. CSCs Collaboration: The CSP should collaborate with the CSCs to understand their specific security requirements and priorities in order to tailor its vulnerability prioritization strategies to better align with CSC needs and risk tolerance
h.Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: The CSP should continuously monitor and adopt evolving cloud security best practices, including those related to vulnerability prioritization
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
For all identified vulnerabilities on virtual machines, platform applications, the CSC should use a risk-based model for effective prioritization of vulnerability remediation using an industry-recognized framework such as but not limited to: CVSS, OWASP risk rating methodology, EPSS, SSVC, etc.

SaaS CSCs should consider prioritizing vulnerabilities on the SaaS application as part of the cloud service they consume to protect their data, maintain business continuity, and comply with security regulations.

Here are some key steps SaaS CSCs should take to prioritize vulnerabilities:
a. Understand the SaaS CSP’s vulnerability management (VM) program: The maturity and effectiveness of the SaaS vendor's VM program should be assessed and understood. This includes understanding their vulnerability scanning frequency, prioritization criteria, remediation processes, and communication protocols.
b. Vulnerability Disclosure and Remediation: The CSPs's responsibilities for vulnerability disclosure, remediation timelines, and communication procedures should be understood. Ensure that the vendor's service level agreement (SLA) includes specific commitments related to vulnerability management
c. Vulnerability Reports and Remediation Progress: Vulnerability reports provided by the SaaS CSP should be regularly reviewed and their progress tracked in remediating critical vulnerabilities. This information should be used to assess the vendor's responsiveness and overall VM effectiveness
d. Independent Vulnerability Scans: Conducting independent vulnerability scans on the SaaS application should be considered to supplement the CSP's scanning efforts. This can provide additional assurance and identify any vulnerabilities that may have been missed by the vendor's scans
e. CSC Risk Tolerance: The severity of vulnerabilities should be assessed based on SaaS CSC risk tolerance and the potential impact on its business. Vulnerabilities that affect critical data should be prioritized, essential business functions supported, when posing a high likelihood of exploitation.
f. SaaS CSP Communication: Maintain open communication with the SaaS vendor regarding vulnerabilities. Share your prioritization criteria and collaborate on remediation plans to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively
g. Third-party Vulnerability Management: Using third-party vulnerability management services should be considered to provide an independent assessment of the SaaS application's security posture and identify potential vulnerabilities
h. Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities: Security advisories and threat intelligence feeds should be continuously monitored to stay up-to-date on emerging threats and vulnerabilities that could affect the SaaS application
i. Vulnerability Prioritization Strategy Update: As the CSC business needs and the threat landscape evolve, the vulnerability prioritization strategy should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it aligns with the current risk tolerance and security requirements

By following these steps, SaaS CSCs can effectively prioritize vulnerabilities, reduce security risks, and protect their data and business operations from potential threats.
