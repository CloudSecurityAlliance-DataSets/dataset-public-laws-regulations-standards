The infamous “flash crash” of 2010 is an instance of this: numerous stock trading algorithms from a variety of companies interacted in a fashion that rapidly devalued the US stock market by over 1 trillion dollars in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, humans were able to intervene afterward and reverse the damage, but that might not always be possible as AI technology becomes more powerful and pervasive.""",3,4,1 - Human,2 - Unintentional,3 - Other,6.

,Example row 3 →,TASRA: a Taxonomy and Analysis of Societal-Scale Risks from AI,Critch2023,01.01.00.a,Additional evidence,Type 1: Diffusion of responsibility,,1,"Example: ""Scientists develop an algorithm for predicting the answers to questions about a person, as a function of freely available and purchasable information about the person (social media, resumes, browsing history, purchasing history, etc.). The algorithm is made freely available to the public, and employers begin using the algorithm to screen out potential hires by asking, “Is this person likely to be arrested in the next year?” Courts and regulatory bodies attempt to ban the technology by evoking privacy norms, but struggle to establish cases against the use of publicly available information, so the technology broadly remains in use. Innocent people who share certain characteristics with past convicted criminals end up struggling to get jobs, become disproportionately unemployed, and correspondingly more often commit theft to fulfill basic needs. Meanwhile, police also use the algorithm to prioritize their investigations, and since unemployment is a predictor of property crime, the algorithm leads them to suspect and arrest more unemployed people. Some of the arrests are talked about on social media, so the algorithm learns that the arrested individuals are likely to be arrested again, making it even more difficult for them to get jobs. A cycle of deeply unfair socioeconomic discrimination begins.""",,,,,,,
