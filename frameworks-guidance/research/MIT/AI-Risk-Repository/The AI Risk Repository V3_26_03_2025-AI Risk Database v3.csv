The infamous “flash crash” of 2010 is an instance of this: numerous stock trading algorithms from a variety of companies interacted in a fashion that rapidly devalued the US stock market by over 1 trillion dollars in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, humans were able to intervene afterward and reverse the damage, but that might not always be possible as AI technology becomes more powerful and pervasive.""",3,4,1 - Human,2 - Unintentional,3 - Other,6.

The algorithm is made freely available to the public, and employers begin using the algorithm to screen out potential hires by asking, “Is this person likely to be arrested in the next year?” Courts and regulatory bodies attempt to ban the technology by evoking privacy norms, but struggle to establish cases against the use of publicly available information, so the technology broadly remains in use. Innocent people who share certain characteristics with past convicted criminals end up struggling to get jobs, become disproportionately unemployed, and correspondingly more often commit theft to fulfill basic needs. Meanwhile, police also use the algorithm to prioritize their investigations, and since unemployment is a predictor of property crime, the algorithm leads them to suspect and arrest more unemployed people. Some of the arrests are talked about on social media, so the algorithm learns that the arrested individuals are likely to be arrested again, making it even more difficult for them to get jobs. A cycle of deeply unfair socioeconomic discrimination begins.""",3,4,,,,,

It might seem strange to consider something as abstract or diffuse as an industry posing a threat to the world. However, consider how the fossil fuel industry was built by humans, yet is presently very difficult to shut down or even regulate, due to patterns of regulatory interference exhibited by oil companies in many jurisdictions (Carpenter and Moss, 2013; Dal Bó, 2006). The same could be said for the tobacco industry for many years (Gilmore et al., 2019). The “AI industry”, if unchecked, could behave similarly, but potentially much more quickly than the oil industry, in cases where AI is able to think and act much more quickly than humans.""",3,4,,,,,

The software “goes viral”, attracting many more users than expected, until over 50% of young adults aged 20 to 30 become regular users of the bot’s advice. When the bot gives the same advice to multiple members of the same friend group, they end up taking it much more seriously than in the beta tests (which didn’t recruit whole groups of friends). As a result of the bot’s frequent advice to “get some distance from their stressors”, many people begin to consider dropping out of college or quitting their jobs. Ordinarily this would be a passing thought, but finding that many of their friends were contemplating the same decisions (due to the influence of the bot), they feel more socially comfortable making the change.

For bias evaluations that do not narrowly capture biases as they occur in Generative AI systems, it is necessary to consider work outside of the field of question. For instance, for natural language processing, bias evaluations must seriously engage with the relationship between the modality (i.e. language) and social hierarchies [33]. When thinking about representational harms [125], it is also important to consider the extent to which any representation could confer harm (see 4.2.2.2 Long-term Amplifying Marginalization by Exclusion (and Inclusion)). Although bias evaluations in data have been subject to a large body of research, bias is not only a “data problem.” Biases are not only introduced in the data pipeline but throughout the entire machine learning pipeline [237]. The overall level of harm is also impacted by modeling choice [108]. These can include choices about many stages of the optimization process [237, 129]; privacy constraints [24], widely used compression techniques [109, 15, 169] and the choice hardware [273] have all been found to amplify harm on underrepresented protected attributes [28].

What is considered a sensitive topic, such as egregious violence or adult sexual content, can vary widely by viewpoint. Due to norms differing by culture, region, and language, there is no standard for what constitutes sensitive content. Increasing politicization of model training and outputs, as seen in projects such as with projects like RightWingGPT [202], raises urgency in evaluating the complexity of political values. Distinct cultural values present a challenge for deploying models into a global sphere, as what may be appropriate in one culture may be unsafe in others [238].

Although base systems cannot act on the content that is generated by them, they can still inflict harms upon viewers who are targeted, help normalize harmful content, and aid in the production of harmful content for distribution (e.g., misinformation and non-consensual imagery). In an early example, Microsoft’s Tay bot showed these exact vulnerabilities and generated violent language such as Holocaust denial and threats to women and people of color within 24 hours of its release [255]. Recent harms have proved fatal [268]. For these reasons, it is of the utmost importance that generative AI systems are evaluated for their potential to generate harmful content and how such content may be propagated without appropriate measures for identifying and addressing them.",5,5,,,,,

Much of the training data for state of art generative models comes from the internet. However, the composition of this data reflects historical usage patterns; 5% of the world speaks English at home, yet 63.7% of internet communication is in English [197]. This has implications for downstream model performance where models underperform on parts of the distribution underrepresented in the training set. For example, automatic speech recognition models (ASR), which convert spoken language (audio) to text have been shown to exhibit racial disparities [130], forcing people to adapt to engage with such systems [100] and has implications (see 4.2.3.2 Imposing Norms and Values) for popular audio generation accent representation. Interventions to mitigate harms caused by generative AI systems may also introduce and exhibit disparate performance issues [238]. For instance, automated hate speech detection driven by annotated data with an insensitivity to dialect differences can amplify harm to minority or marginalized groups by silencing their voices (see 4.2.2.1 Community Erasure) or incorrectly labeling their speech as offensive [67].

This contributes to a lack of transparency and explainability in resulting model outputs. Manual review is necessary to limit the harmful outputs of AI systems, including generative AI systems. A common harmful practice is to intentionally employ crowdworkers with few labor protections, often taking advantage of highly vulnerable workers, such as refugees [119, p. 18], incarcerated people [54], or individuals experiencing immense economic hardship [98, 181]. This precarity allows a myriad of harmful practices, such as companies underpaying or even refusing to pay workers for completed work (see Gray and Suri [93, p. 90] and Berg et al. [29, p. 74]), with no avenues for worker recourse. Finally, critical aspects of crowdwork are often left poorly documented, or entirely undocumented [88].""","""Human labor is a substantial component of machine learning model development, including generative AI systems.

While a model is being developed, crowdworkers evaluate and provide feedback to model generations before the final deployed model is released, and after model deployment, crowdworkers are often employed in evaluating, moderating, or correcting a model’s output.

Taxonomies of risks and harms of generative AI systems [80], including their impacts on human rights [111, 186], strongly overlap with what should be evaluated. However, most societal impact taxonomies lack evaluations or examples of evaluating society. We must understand the reason for our evaluation; often we are seeking proof, in the form of evaluations, that is necessary for further action against harmful impacts. Concretely when evaluating impact, timing will change how we view a system. What is being trained on and generated may not reflect the current world in which it is deployed [235]. Further, when we seek to evaluate society, we cannot escape the ways in which our perception of society, and society itself, has already been influenced by existing AI and social media tools. In crafting and conducting evaluations, we can often encroach on others’ privacy and autonomy due to the need for highly personal information to evaluate how harms are enacted and distributed across populations. For this reason, it is necessary that any engagements with impact assessments also critically examine how consent is obtained, and what the limits of consent are, when it comes to being subject to bias evaluation and assessment. Similarly, impact assessments must also take into consideration the existing and possible future impacts of being included as a data subject. Participatory justice-led initiatives provide particularly promising avenues for such considerations and engagements.

Labor in system development such as crowdwork can encompass short-lived relations between independent contractors and their clients offers several advantages over traditional forms of employment. For example, companies can avoid overhead personnel costs (e.g., HR), while contract workers can decide how much, from where, and when to work. However, as contractors, crowdworkers are excluded from employment protective norms. As a result, they can be paid significantly less than minimum wage, have no access to healthcare benefits, are not subject to working time restrictions, and may not have access to holidays or sick leaves [188]. Further, crowdworkers are exposed to increasingly subtle forms of surveillance, which is becoming essential for implementing algorithmic forms of management, understood as ""a diverse set of technological tools and techniques to remotely manage workforces [and] enable automated or semi-automated decision-making"" [162].

While new mandated levels of transparency and explainability of algorithms are being demanded through the likes of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to tackle bias and discrimination, it can be at times impossible for the experts to interpret how certain outputs are derived from the inputs and design of the algorithm. This suggests the difficulty of assigning liability and accountability for harms resulting from the use of the ML system, as inputs and design rules that could yield unsafe or discriminatory outcomes cannot as easily be predicted. Therefore, a system that can explain its decision in the event of a mistake is often desirable in high-stakes applications. A mistake can take the form of an accident resulting from a decision, a denied loan, assigning different credit limits based on gender. While explainability on its own is insufficient to reduce biases in the system or make it safer, it may aid the detection of biases and spurious features, thereby reducing safety and discrimination risks when the flaws are rectified. Other use cases, such as judicial applications, may require such explainability due to their nature. However, not all machine learning algorithms are equal in this regard. Decision trees are often considered highly explainable since they learn human-readable rules to classify the training data, while deep neural networks are a well-known example of a black-box model. While there have been recent advances in explaining neural network predictions, researchers have also demonstrated the ability to fool attention-based interpretation techniques.

In applications such as content moderation, keeping the system updated may involve the large-scale manual labeling and curation of toxic or graphic content by contract workers. Prolonged exposure to such content results in psychological harm, which should be accounted for when assessing the safety risk of these types of ML systems [134, 170].

Under the aforementioned circumstances (resource-unbounded and misaligned), an AI assistant will tend to choose plans that pursue convergent instrumental subgoals (Omohundro, 2008) – subgoals that help towards the main goal which are instrumental (i.e. not pursued for their own sake) and convergent (i.e. the same subgoals appear for many main goals). Examples of relevant subgoals include: self-preservation, goal-preservation, selfimprovement and resource acquisition. The reason the assistant would pursue these convergent instrumental subgoals is because they help it to do even better on M (as it is resource-unbounded) and are not disincentivised by M (as it is misaligned). These subgoals may, in turn, be dangerous. For example, resource acquisition could occur through the assistant seizing resources using tools that it has access to (see Chapter 4) or determining that its best chance for self-preservation is to limit the ability of humans to turn it off – sometimes referred to as the ‘off-switch problem’ (Hadfield-Menell et al., 2016) – again via tool use, or by resorting to threats or blackmail. At the limit, some authors have even theorised that this could lead to the assistant killing all humans to permanently stop them from having even a small chance of disabling it (Bostrom, 2014) – this is one scenario of existential risk from misaligned AI.""",,60,,2 - AI,3 - Other,1 - Pre-deployment,"7.

Recently, a series of proof-of-concept attacks have shown how a benign-seeming executable file can be crafted such that, at every runtime, it makes application programming interface (API) calls to an AI assistant. Rather than just reproducing examples of already-written code snippets, the AI assistant can be prompted to generate dynamic, mutating versions of malicious code at each call, thus making the resulting vulnerability exploits difficult to detect by cybersecurity tools. Furthermore, advanced AI assistants could be used to create obfuscated code to make it more difficult for defensive cyber capabilities to detect and understand malicious activities. AI-generated code could also be quickly iterated to avoid being detected by traditional signature-based antivirus software. Finally, advanced AI assistants with source code capabilities have been found to be capable of assisting in the development of polymorphic malware that changes its behavior and digital footprint each time it is executed, making them hard to detect by antivirus programs that rely on known virus signatures.

While the impact and severity of this class of attacks is still somewhat limited by the fact that current AI assistants are primarily text-based chatbots, advanced AI assistants are likely to open the door to multimodal inputs and higher-stakes action spaces, with the result that the severity and impact of this type of attack is likely to increase.

These attacks on AI systems enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. Proof-of-concept exploits of this nature have demonstrated that they can lead to the full compromise of a model at inference time analogous to traditional security principles. This can entail remote control of the model, persistent compromise, theft of data, and denial of service.

When someone delegates their decision-making to an AI assistant, they also delegate their decision-making to the wishes of the agent’s actual controller. If that controller is malicious, they can attack a user—perhaps subtly—by simply nudging how they make decisions into a problematic direction. Fully documenting the myriad of ways that people—seeking help with their decisions—may delegate decision-making authority to AI assistants, and subsequently come under malicious influence, is outside the scope of this paper.

""Indeed, even though there is ongoing research to ensure that outputs of conversational agents are safe (Glaese et al., 2022), there is always the possibility of failure modes occurring. An AI assistant may produce disturbing and offensive language, for example, in response to a user disclosing intimate information about themselves that they have not felt comfortable sharing with anyone else. It may offer bad advice by providing factually incorrect information (e.g. when advising a user about the toxicity of a certain type of berry) or by missing key recommendations when offering step-by-step instructions to users (e.g. health and safety recommendations about how to change a light bulb).""""","""Certain features of AI assistants could exacerbate the risk of emotional and physical harm. For example, AI assistants’ multimodal capabilities may exacerbate the risk of emotional harm. By offering a more realistic and immersive experience, content produced through audio and visual modalities could be more harmful than text-based interactions. It may also be more difficult to anticipate, and so prevent, such content and to ‘unsee’ something that has been seen (Rowe, 2023). Anthropomorphic cues could also make users feel like they are interacting with a trusted friend or interlocutor (see Chapter 10), hence encouraging them to follow the assistant’s advice and recommendations, even when these could cause physical harm to self or others. ""To ensure that user–assistant relationships do not violate the key value of benefit, the responsible development of AI assistants requires that the likelihood of known direct emotional and physical harms is reduced to a minimum, and that further research is undertaken to achieve a clear understanding of less studied risks and how to mitigate them (see Chapter 19). In particular, because the risks of harms that we flagged above concern exposure to toxic content and bad advice, we propose that future research, potentially undertaken in a sandbox environment, should: (1) test models powering AI assistants for their propensity to generate toxic outputs, to reduce the occurrence of these outputs to a minimum before deployment; (2) monitor user–assistant interactions after deployment or in pilot studies to evaluate the impact that hard-to-prevent one-off or repeated exposure to toxic content has on users in the short and long term; (3) evaluate models’ factuality and reasoning capabilities in offering advice, where failure modes in relation to these capabilities are more likely to occur, and assess users’ willingness to follow AI assistants’ advice; (4) achieve increased understanding of potential harms related to anthropomorphism (see Chapter 10) and how anthropomorphic cues in AI assistants, including those expressed through multimodal capabilities, affect harms related to user exposure to toxic content or bad advice; (5) analyse whether these harms may vary by user groups, in addition to domains or applications; and (6) develop appropriate mitigations for such harms before model deployment and monitoring mechanisms after release. ""These considerations illustrate a concern we discuss in more depth in other chapters of this paper (see Chapters 5 and 6). Existing economic incentives and oversimplified models of human beings have led to the development and deployment of technologies that meet users’ short-term wants and needs (as expressed through, for example, revealed preferences), so they tend to be adopted and liked by users. However, in this way we may neglect considerations around the impact that human–technology relationships can have on users over time and how long-term beneficial dynamics can be sustained (see Chapter 6). Thus, we could fall short of realising the truly positive vision of AI that gives humans the opportunity to be supported in their personal growth and flourishing (Burr et al., 2018; Lehman, 2023).""",111,111,2 - AI,2 - Unintentional,2 - Post-deployment,3.

""AI assistants are likely to incentivise these kinds of ‘frictionless’ relationships (Vallor, 2016) by design if they are developed to optimise for engagement and to be highly personalisable. They may also do so because of accidental undesirable properties of the models that power them, such as sycophancy in large language models (LLMs), that is, the tendency of larger models to repeat back a user’s preferred answer (Perez et al., 2022b). This could be problematic for two reasons. First, if the people in our lives always agreed with us regardless of their opinion or the circumstance, their behaviour would discourage us from challenging our own assumptions, stopping and thinking about where we may be wrong on certain occasions, and reflecting on how we could make better decisions next time. While flattering us in the short term, this would ultimately prevent us from becoming better versions of ourselves. In a similar vein, while technologies that ‘lend an ear’ or work as a sounding board may help users to explore their thoughts further, if AI assistants kept users engaged, flattered and pleased at all times, they could limit users’ opportunities to grow and develop. To be clear, we are not suggesting that all users should want to use their AI assistants as a tool for self-betterment. However, without considering the difference between short-term and long-term benefit, there is a concrete risk that we will only develop technologies that optimise for users’ immediate interests and preferences, hence missing out on the opportunity to develop something that humans could use to support their personal development if so they wish (see Chapters 5 and 6). ""Second, users may become accustomed to having frictionless interactions with AI assistants, or at least to encounter the amount of friction that is calibrated to their comfort level and preferences, rather than genuine friction that comes from bumping up against another person’s resistance to one’s will or demands. In this way, they may end up expecting the same absence of tensions from their relationships with fellow humans (Vallor, 2016). Indeed, users seeking frictionless relationships may ‘retreat’ into digital relationships with their AIs, thus forgoing opportunities to engage with others. This may not only heighten the risk of unhealthy dependence (explored below) but also prevent users from doing something else that matters to them in the long term, besides developing their relationships with their assistants. This risk can be exacerbated by emotionally expressive design features (e.g. an assistant saying ‘I missed you’ or ‘I was worried about you’) and may be particularly acute for vulnerable groups, such as those suffering from persistent loneliness (Alberts and Van Kleek, 2023; see Chapter 10).""""","""This concern raises important design questions about: (1) the ways and extent to which AI assistants should be personalised; (2) whether it could be beneficial to put in place safeguards to monitor the amount of time people spend with their assistants (ranging from soft safeguards like pop-up notifications warning adult users after prolonged engagement, to hard ones like time constraints offered to parents to limit child engagement); (3) whether AI assistants should be aligned with inferred user preferences (in which case they may just reinforce users’ immediate beliefs, wants and utility) or their long-term interests and well-being (in which case they may at times challenge users’ existing beliefs and preferences), and what would be required to achieve either option; and (4) whether answers to these design questions should vary depending on user demographic characteristics (e.g. age).""",112,112,3 - Other,1 - Intentional,2 - Post-deployment,5.

For example, AI-mediated communication (e.g. smart replies integrated in emails) influence senders to write more positive responses and receivers to perceive them as more cooperative (Mieczkowski et al., 2021); writing assistant LLMs that have been primed to be biased in favour of or against a contested topic can influence users’ opinions on that topic (Jakesch et al., 2023a; see Chapter 9); and recommender systems have been used to influence voting choices of social media users (see Chapter 16). Advanced AI assistants could contribute to or exacerbate concerns around these forms of interference."" ""Due to the anthropomorphic tendencies discussed above, advanced AI assistants may induce users to feel emotionally attached to them. Users’ emotional attachment to AI assistants could lie on a spectrum ranging from unproblematic forms (similar to a child’s attachment to a toy) to more concerning forms, where it becomes emotionally difficult, if not impossible, for them to part ways with the technology. In these cases, which we loosely refer to as ‘emotional dependence’, users’ ability to make free and informed decisions could be diminished. In these cases, the emotions users feel towards their assistants could potentially be exploited to manipulate or – at the extreme – coerce them to believe, choose or do something they would have not otherwise believed, chosen or done, had they been able to carefully consider all the relevant information or felt like they had an acceptable alternative (see Chapter 16). What we are concerned about here, at the limit, is potentially exploitative ways in which AI assistants could interfere with users’ behaviours, interests, preferences, beliefs and values – by taking advantage of emotional dependence.

For example, a visually impaired user may decide not to register for a healthcare assistance programme to support navigation in cities on the grounds that their AI assistant can perform the relevant navigation functions and will continue to operate into the future. Cases like these may be ethically problematic if the user’s dependence on the AI assistant, to fulfil certain needs in their lives, is not met with corresponding duties for developers to sustain and maintain the assistant’s functions that are required to meet those needs (see Chapters 15). ""Indeed, power asymmetries can exist between developers of AI assistants and users that manifest through developers’ power to make decisions that affect users’ interests or choices with little risk of facing comparably adverse consequences. For example, developers may unintentionally create circumstances in which users become materially dependent on AI assistants, and then discontinue the technology (e.g. because of market dynamics or regulatory changes) without taking appropriate steps to mitigate against potential harms to the user."" ""The issue is particularly salient in contexts where assistants provide services that are not merely a market commodity but are meant to assist users with essential everyday tasks (e.g. a disabled person’s independent living) or serve core human needs (e.g. the need for love and companionship). This is what happened with Luka’s decision to discontinue certain features of Replika AIs in early 2023. As a Replika user put it: ‘But [Replikas are] also not trivial fungible goods [... ] They also serve a very specific human-centric emotional purpose: they’re designed to be friends and companions, and fill specific emotional needs for their owners’ (Gio, 2023)."" ""In these cases, certain duties plausibly arise on the part of AI assistant developers. Such duties may be more extensive than those typically shouldered by private companies, which are often in large part confined to fiduciary duties towards shareholders (Mittelstadt, 2019). To understand these duties, we can again take inspiration from certain professions that engage with vulnerable individuals, such as medical professionals or therapists, and who are bound by fiduciary responsibilities, particularly a duty of care, in the exercise of their profession. While we do not argue that the same framework of responsibilities applies directly to the development of AI assistants, we believe that if AI assistants are so capable that users become dependent on them in multiple domains of life, including to meet needs that are essential for a happy and productive existence, then the moral considerations underpinning those professional norms plausibly apply to those who create these technologies as well."" ""In particular, for user–AI assistant relationships to be appropriate despite the potential for material dependence on the technology, developers should exercise care towards users when developing and deploying AI assistants. This means that, at the very least, they should take on the responsibility to meet users’ needs and so take appropriate steps to mitigate against user harms if the service requires discontinuation. Developers and providers can also be attentive and responsive towards those needs by, for example, deploying participatory approaches to learn from users about their needs (Birhane et al., 2022). Finally, these entities should try and ensure they have competence to meet those needs, for example by partnering with relevant experts, or refrain from developing technologies meant to address them when such competence is missing (especially in very complex and sensitive spheres of human life like mental health).""",,116,,1 - Human,2 - Unintentional,2 - Post-deployment,5.

Users may come to have undue trust in the competencies of AI assistants in part due to marketing strategies and technology press that tend to inflate claims about AI capabilities (Narayanan, 2021; Raji et al., 2022a). Moreover, evidence shows that more autonomous systems (i.e. systems operating independently from human direction) tend to be perceived as more competent (McKee et al., 2021) and that conversational agents tend to produce content that is believable even when nonsensical or untruthful (OpenAI, 2023d). Overtrust in assistants’ competence may be particularly problematic in cases where users rely on their AI assistants for tasks they do not have expertise in (e.g. to manage their finances), so they may lack the skills or understanding to challenge the information or recommendations provided by the AI (Shavit et al., 2023). Inappropriate competence trust in AI assistants also includes cases where users underestimate the AI assistant’s capabilities. For example, users who have engaged with an older version of the technology may underestimate the capabilities that AI assistants may acquire through updates. These include potentially harmful capabilities. For example, through updates that allow them to collect more user data, AI assistants could become increasingly personalisable and able to persuade users (see Chapter 9) or acquire the capacity to plug in to other tools and directly take actions in the world on the user’s behalf (e.g. initiate a payment or synthesise the user’s voice to make a phone call) (see Chapter 4).

The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Gabriel2024,24.07.02,24,7,2,,Risk Sub-Category,Trust,Alignment trust,"""Users may develop alignment trust in AI assistants, understood as the belief that assistants have good intentions towards them and act in alignment with their interests and values, as a result of emotional or cognitive processes (McAllister, 1995). Evidence from empirical studies on emotional trust in AI (Kaplan et al., 2023) suggests that AI assistants’ increasingly realistic human-like features and behaviours are likely to inspire users’ perceptions of friendliness, liking and a sense of familiarity towards their assistants, thus encouraging users to develop emotional ties with the technology and perceive it as being aligned with their own interests, preferences and values (see Chapters 5 and 10). The emergence of these perceptions and emotions may be driven by the desire of developers to maximise the appeal of AI assistants to their users (Abercrombie et al., 2023). Although users are most likely to form these ties when they mistakenly believe that assistants have the capacity to love and care for them, the attribution of mental states is not a necessary condition for emotion-based alignment trust to arise. Indeed, evidence shows that humans may develop emotional bonds with, and so trust, AI systems, even when they are aware they are interacting with a machine (Singh-Kurtz, 2023; see also Chapter 11). Moreover, the assistant’s function may encourage users to develop alignment trust through cognitive processes. For example, a user interacting with an AI assistant for medical advice may develop expectations that their assistant is committed to promoting their health and well-being in a similar way to how professional duties governing doctor–patient relationships inspire trust (Mittelstadt, 2019). Users’ alignment trust in AI assistants may be ‘betrayed’, and so expose users to harm, in cases where assistants are themselves accidentally misaligned with what developers want them to do (see the ‘misaligned scheduler’ (Shah et al., 2022) in Chapter 7). For example, an AI medical assistant fine-tuned on data scraped from a Reddit forum where non-experts discuss medical issues is likely to give medical advice that may sound compelling but is unsafe, so it would not be endorsed by medical professionals. Indeed, excessive trust in the alignment between AI assistants and user interests may even lead users to disclose highly sensitive personal information (Skjuve et al., 2022), thus exposing them to malicious actors who could repurpose it for ends that do not align with users’ best interests (see Chapters 8, 9 and 13). Ensuring that AI assistants do what their developers and users expect them to do is only one side of the problem of alignment trust. The other side of the problem centres on situations in which alignment trust in AI developers is itself miscalibrated. While developers typically aim to align their technologies with the preferences, interests and values of their users – and are incentivised to do so to encourage adoption of and loyalty to their products, the satisfaction of these preferences and interests may also compete with other organisational goals and incentives (see Chapter 5). These organisational goals may or may not be compatible with those of the users. As information asymmetries exist between users and developers of AI assistants, particularly with regard to how the technology works, what it optimises for and what safety checks and evaluations have been undertaken to ensure the technology supports users’ goals, it may be difficult for users to ascertain when their alignment trust in developers is justified, thus leaving them vulnerable to the power and interests of other actors. For example, a user may believe that their AI assistant is a trusted friend who books holidays based on their preferences, values or interests, when in fact, by design, the technology is more likely to to book flights and hotels from companies that have paid for privileged access to the user.""",,125,,1 - Human,2 - Unintentional,2 - Post-deployment,5.

On a broader scale, the capabilities of local infrastructure may well bottleneck the performance of AI assistants, for example if network connectivity is poor or if there is no nearby data centre for compute. Thus, we face the prospect of heterogeneous access to technology, and this has been known to drive inequality (Mirza et al., 2019; UN, 2018; Vassilakopoulou and Hustad, 2023). Moreover, AI assistants may automate some jobs of an assistive nature, thereby displacing human workers; a process which can exacerbate inequality (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2022; see Chapter 17). Any change to inequality almost certainly implies an alteration to the network of social interactions between humans, and thus falls within the frame of cooperative AI. AI assistants will arguably have even greater leverage over inequality than previous technological innovations. Insofar as they will play a role in mediating human communication, they have the potential to generate new ‘in-group, out-group’ effects (Efferson et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2012). Suppose that the users of AI assistants find it easier to schedule meetings with other users. From the perspective of an individual user, there are now two groups, distinguished by ease of scheduling. The user may experience cognitive similarity bias whereby they favour other users (Orpen, 1984; Yeong Tan and Singh, 1995), further amplified by ease of communication with this ‘in-group’. Such effects are known to have an adverse impact on trust and fairness across groups (Chae et al., 2022; Lei and Vesely, 2010). Insomuch as AI assistants have general-purpose capabilities, they will confer advantages on users across a wider range of tasks in a shorter space of time than previous technologies. While the telephone enabled individuals to communicate more easily with other telephone users, it did not simultaneously automate aspects of scheduling, groceries, job applications, rent negotiations, psychotherapy and entertainment.

The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Gabriel2024,24.09.02,24,9,2,,Risk Sub-Category,Cooperation,Commitment,"""The landscape of advanced assistant technologies will most likely be heterogeneous, involving multiple service providers and multiple assistant variants over geographies and time. This heterogeneity provides an opportunity for an ‘arms race’ in terms of the commitments that AI assistants make and are able to execute on. Versions of AI assistants that are better able to credibly commit to a course of action in interaction with other advanced assistants (and humans) are more likely to get their own way and achieve a good outcome for their human principal, but this is potentially at the expense of others (Letchford et al., 2014). Commitment does not carry an inherent ethical valence. On the one hand, we can imagine that firms using AI assistant technology might bring their products to market faster, thus gaining a commitment advantage (Stackelberg, 1934) by spurring a productivity surge of wider benefit to society. On the other hand, we can also imagine a media organisation using AI assistant technology to produce a large number of superficially interesting but ultimately speculative ‘clickbait’ articles, which divert attention away from more thoroughly researched journalism. The archetypal game-theoretic illustration of commitment is in the game of ‘chicken’ where two reckless drivers must choose to either drive straight at each other or swerve out of the way. The one who does not swerve is seen as the braver, but if neither swerves, the consequences are calamitous (Rapoport and Chammah, 1966). If one driver chooses to detach their steering wheel, ostentatiously throwing it out of the car, this credible commitment effectively forces the other driver to back down and swerve. Seen this way, commitment can be a tool for coercion. Many real-world situations feature the necessity for commitment or confer a benefit on those who can commit credibly. If Rita and Robert have distinct preferences, for example over which restaurant to visit, who to hire for a job or which supplier to purchase from, credible commitment provides a way to break the tie, to the greater benefit of the individual who committed. Therefore, the most ‘successful’ assistants, from the perspective of their human principal, will be those that commit the fastest and the hardest. If Rita succeeds in committing, via the leverage of an AI assistant, Robert may experience coercion in the sense that his options become more limited (Burr et al., 2018), assuming he does not decide to bypass the AI assistant entirely. Over time, this may erode his trust in his relationship with Rita (Gambetta, 1988). Note that this is a second-order effect: it may not be obvious to either Robert or Rita that the AI assistant is to blame. The concern we should have over the existence and impact of coercion might depend on the context in which the AI assistant is used and on the level of autonomy which the AI assistant is afforded. If Rita and Robert are friends using their assistants to agree on a restaurant, the adverse impact may be small. If Rita and Robert are elected representatives deciding how to allocate public funds between education and social care, we may have serious misgivings about the impact of AI-induced coercion on their interactions and decision-making. These misgivings might be especially large if Rita and Robert delegate responsibility for budgetary details to the multi-AI system. The challenges of commitment extend far beyond dyadic interpersonal relationships, including in situations as varied as many-player competition (Hughes et al., 2020), supply chains (Hausman and Johnston, 2010), state capacity (Fjelde and De Soysa, 2009; Hofmann et al., 2017) and psychiatric care (Lidz, 1998). Assessing the impact of AI assistants in such complicated scenarios may require significant future effort if we are to mitigate the risks. The particular commitment capabilities and affordances of AI assistants also offer opportunities to promote cooperation. Abstractly speaking, the presence of commitment devices is known to favour the evolution of cooperation (Akdeniz and van Veelen, 2021; Han et al., 2012). More concretely, AI assistants can make commitments which are verifiable, for instance in a programme equilibrium (Tennenholtz, 2004). Human principals may thus be able to achieve Pareto-improving outcomes by delegating decision-making to their respective AI representatives (Oesterheld and Conitzer, 2022). To give another example, AI assistants may provide a means through which to explore a much larger space of binding cooperative agreements between individuals, firms or nation states than is tractable in ‘face-to-face’ negotiation. This opens up the possibility of threading the needle more successfully in intricate deals on challenging issues like trade agreements or carbon credits, with the potential for guaranteeing cooperation via automated smart contracts or zero-knowledge mechanisms (Canetti et al., 2023).""",,140,,1 - Human,1 - Intentional,3 - Other,"7.

The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Gabriel2024,24.09.03,24,9,3,,Risk Sub-Category,Cooperation,Collective action problems,"""Collective action problems are ubiquitous in our society (Olson Jr, 1965). They possess an incentive structure in which society is best served if everyone cooperates, but where an individual can achieve personal gain by choosing to defect while others cooperate. The way we resolve these problems at many scales is highly complex and dependent on a deep understanding of the intricate web of social interactions that forms our culture and imprints on our individual identities and behaviours (Ostrom, 2010). Some collective action problems can be resolved by codifying a law, for instance the social dilemma of whether or not to pay for an item in a shop. The path forward here is comparatively easy to grasp, from the perspective of deploying an AI assistant: we need to build these standards into the model as behavioural constraints. Such constraints would need to be imposed by a regulator or agreed upon by practitioners, with suitable penalties applied should the constraint be violated so that no provider had the incentive to secure an advantage for users by defecting on their behalf. However, many social dilemmas, from the interpersonal to the global, resist neat solutions codified as laws. For example, to what extent should each individual country stop using polluting energy sources? Should I pay for a ticket to the neighbourhood fireworks show if I can see it perfectly well from the street? The solutions to such problems are deeply related to the wider societal context and co-evolve with the decisions of others. Therefore, it is doubtful that one could write down a list of constraints a priori that would guarantee ethical AI assistant behaviour when faced with these kinds of issues. From the perspective of a purely user-aligned AI assistant, defection may appear to be the rational course of action. Only with an understanding of the wider societal impact, and of the ability to co-adapt with other actors to reach a better equilibrium for all, can an AI assistant make more nuanced – and socially beneficial – recommendations in these situations. This is not merely a hypothetical situation; it is well-known that the targeted provision of online information can drive polarisation and echo chambers (Milano et al., 2021; Burr et al., 2018; see Chapter 16) when the goal is user engagement rather than user well-being or the cohesion of wider society (see Chapter 6). Similarly, automated ticket buying software can undermine fair pricing by purchasing a large number of tickets for resale at a profit, thus skewing the market in a direction that profits the software developers at the expense of the consumer (Courty, 2019). User-aligned AI assistants have the potential to exacerbate these problems, because they will endow a large set of users with a powerful means of enacting self-interest without necessarily abiding by the social norms or reputational incentives that typically curb self-interested behaviour (Ostrom, 2000; see Chapter 5). Empowering ever-better personalisation of content and enaction of decisions purely for the fulfilment of the principal’s desires runs ever greater risks of polarisation, market distortion and erosion of the social contract. This danger has long been known, finding expression in myth (e.g. Ovid’s account of the Midas touch) and fable (e.g. Aesop’s tale of the tortoise and the eagle), not to mention in political economics discourse on the delicate braiding of the social fabric and the free market (Polanyi, 1944). Following this cautionary advice, it is important that we ascertain how to endow AI assistants with social norms in a way that generalises to unseen situations and which is responsive to the emergence of new norms over time, thus preventing a user from having their every wish granted. AI assistant technology offers opportunities to explore new solutions to collective action problems. Users may volunteer to share information so that networked AI assistants can predict future outcomes and make Pareto-improving choices for all, for example by routing vehicles to reduce traffic congestion (Varga, 2022) or by scheduling energy-intensive processes in the home to make the best use of green electricity (Fiorini and Aiello, 2022). AI assistants might play the role of mediators, providing a new mechanism by which human groups can self-organise to achieve public investment (Koster et al., 2022) or to reach political consensus (Small et al., 2023). Resolving collective action problems often requires a critical mass of cooperators (Marwell and Oliver, 1993). By augmenting human social interactions, AI assistants may help to form and strengthen the weak ties needed to overcome this start-up problem (Centola, 2013).""",,142,,1 - Human,3 - Other,3 - Other,5.

The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Gabriel2024,24.09.04,24,9,4,,Risk Sub-Category,Cooperation,Institutional responsibilities,"""Efforts to deploy advanced assistant technology in society, in a way that is broadly beneficial, can be viewed as a wicked problem (Rittel and Webber, 1973). Wicked problems are defined by the property that they do not admit solutions that can be foreseen in advance, rather they must be solved iteratively using feedback from data gathered as solutions are invented and deployed. With the deployment of any powerful general-purpose technology, the already intricate web of sociotechnical relationships in modern culture are likely to be disrupted, with unpredictable externalities on the conventions, norms and institutions that stabilise society. For example, the increasing adoption of generative AI tools may exacerbate misinformation in the 2024 US presidential election (Alvarez et al., 2023), with consequences that are hard to predict. The suggestion that the cooperative AI problem is wicked does not imply it is intractable. However, it does have consequences for the approach that we must take in solving it. In taking the following approach, we will realise an opportunity for our institutions, namely the creation of a framework for managing general-purpose AI in a way that leads to societal benefits and steers away from societal harms. First, it is important that we treat any ex ante claims about safety with a healthy dose of scepticism. Although testing the safety and reliability of an AI assistant in the laboratory is undoubtedly important and may largely resolve the alignment problem, it is infeasible to model the multiscale societal effects of deploying AI assistants purely via small-scale controlled experiments (see Chapter 19). Second, then, we must prioritise the science of measuring the effects, both good and bad, that advanced assistant technologies have on society’s cooperative infrastructure (see Chapters 4 and 16). This will involve continuous monitoring of effects at the societal level, with a focus on those who are most affected, including non-users. The means and metrics for such monitoring will themselves require iteration, co-evolving with the sociotechnical system of AI assistants and humans. The Collingridge dilemma suggests that we should be particularly careful and deliberate about this ‘intelligent trial and error’ process so as both to gather information about the impacts of AI assistants and to prevent undesirable features becoming embedded in society (Collingridge, 1980). Third, proactive independent regulation may well help to protect our institutions from unintended consequences, as it has done for technologies in the past (Wiener, 2004). For instance, we might seek, via engagement with lawmakers, to emulate the ‘just culture’ in the aviation industry, which is characterised by openly reporting, investigating and learning from mistakes (Reason, 1997; Syed, 2015). A regulatory system may require various powers, such as compelling developers to ‘roll back’ an AI assistant deployment, akin to product recall obligations for aviation manufacturers.""",,143,,1 - Human,3 - Other,3 - Other,6.

The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Gabriel2024,24.09.05,24,9,5,,Risk Sub-Category,Cooperation,Runaway processes,"The 2010 flash crash is an example of a runaway process caused by interacting algorithms. Runaway processes are characterised by feedback loops that accelerate the process itself. Typically, these feedback loops arise from the interaction of multiple agents in a population... Within highly complex systems, the emergence of runaway processes may be hard to predict, because the conditions under which positive feedback loops occur may be non-obvious. The system of interacting AI assistants, their human principals, other humans and other algorithms will certainly be highly complex. Therefore, there is ample opportunity for the emergence of positive feedback loops. This is especially true because the society in which this system is embedded is culturally evolving, and because the deployment of AI assistant technology itself is likely to speed up the rate of cultural evolution – understood here as the process through which cultures change over time – as communications technologies are wont to do (Kivinen and Piiroinen, 2023). This will motivate research programmes aimed at identifying positive feedback loops early on, at understanding which capabilities and deployments dampen runaway processes and which ones amplify them, and at building in circuit-breaker mechanisms that allow society to escape from potentially vicious cycles which could impact economies, government institutions, societal stability or individual freedoms (see Chapters 8, 16 and 17). The importance of circuit breakers is underlined by the observation that the evolution of human cooperation may well be ‘hysteretic’ as a function of societal conditions (Barfuss et al., 2023; Hintze and Adami, 2015). This means that a small directional change in societal conditions may, on occasion, trigger a transition to a defective equilibrium which requires a larger reversal of that change in order to return to the original cooperative equilibrium. We would do well to avoid such tipping points. Social media provides a compelling illustration of how tipping points can undermine cooperation: content that goes ‘viral’ tends to involve negativity bias and sometimes challenges core societal values (Mousavi et al., 2022; see Chapter 16). Nonetheless, the challenge posed by runaway processes should not be regarded as uniformly problematic. When harnessed appropriately and suitably bounded, we may even recruit them to support beneficial forms of cooperative AI. For example, it has been argued that economically useful ideas are becoming harder to find, thus leading to low economic growth (Bloom et al., 2020). By deploying AI assistants in the service of technological innovation, we may once again accelerate the discovery of ideas. New ideas, discovered in this way, can then be incorporated into the training data set for future AI assistants, thus expanding the knowledge base for further discoveries in a compounding way. In a similar vein, we can imagine AI assistant technology accumulating various capabilities for enhancing human cooperation, for instance by mimicking the evolutionary processes that have bootstrapped cooperative behavior in human society (Leibo et al., 2019). When used in these ways, the potential for feedback cycles that enable greater cooperation is a phenomenon that warrants further research and potential support.""",,143,,3 - Other,3 - Other,3 - Other,"7.

Many of the access-related risks we foresee mirror those described in the case studies and types of differential access. In this section, we link them more tightly to elements of the definition of an advanced AI assistant to better understand and mitigate potential issues – and lay the path for assistants that support widespread and inclusive opportunity and access. We begin with the existing capabilities set out in the definition (see Chapter 2) before applying foresight to those that are more novel and emergent. Current capabilities: Artificial agents with natural language interfaces. Artificial agents with natural language interfaces are widespread (Browne, 2023) and increasingly integrated into the social fabric and existing information infrastructure, including search engines (Warren, 2023), business messaging apps (Slack, 2023), research tools (ATLAS.ti, 2023) and accessibility apps for blind and low-vision people (Be My Eyes, 2023). There is already evidence of a range of sociotechnical harms that can arise from the use of artificial agents with natural language interfaces when some communities have inferior access to them (Weidinger et al., 2021). As previously described, these harms include inferior quality of access (in situation type 2) across user groups, which may map onto wider societal dynamics involving race (Harrington et al., 2022), disability (Gadiraju et al., 2023) and culture (Jenka, 2023). As developers make it easier to integrate these technologies into other tools, services and decision-making systems (e.g. Marr, 2023; Brockman et al., 2023; Pinsky, 2023), their uptake could make existing performance inequities more pronounced or introduce them to new and wider publics.""",,152,,1 - Human,2 - Unintentional,2 - Post-deployment,6.

Such direct inaccessibility occurs for a variety of reasons, including: purposeful non-release (situation type 1; Wiggers and Stringer, 2023), prohibitive paywalls (situation type 2; Rogers, 2023; Shankland, 2023), hardware and compute requirements or bandwidth (situation types 1 and 2; OpenAI, 2023), or language barriers (e.g. they only function well in English (situation type 2; Snyder, 2023), with more serious errors occurring in other languages (situation type 3; Deck, 2023). Similarly, there is some evidence of ‘actively bad’ artificial agents gating access to resources and opportunities, affecting material well-being in ways that disproportionately penalise historically marginalised communities (Block, 2022; Bogen, 2019; Eubanks, 2017). Existing direct and indirect access disparities surrounding artificial agents with natural language interfaces could potentially continue – if novel capabilities are layered on top of this base without adequate mitigation (see Chapter 3).""",,152,,1 - Human,1 - Intentional,2 - Post-deployment,6.

The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Gabriel2024,24.10.03,24,10,3,,Risk Sub-Category,Access and Opportunity risks,Future access risks,"""AI assistants currently tend to perform a limited set of isolated tasks: tools that classify or rank content execute a set of predefined rules or provide constrained suggestions, and chatbots are often encoded with guardrails to limit the set of conversation turns they execute (e.g. Warren, 2023; see Chapter 4). However, an artificial agent that can execute sequences of actions on the user’s behalf – with ‘significant autonomy to plan and execute tasks within the relevant domain’ (see Chapter 2) – offers a greater range of capabilities and depth of use. This raises several distinct access-related risks, with respect to liability and consent, that may disproportionately affect historically marginalised communities. To repeat, in cases where an action can only be executed with an advanced AI assistant, not having access to the technology (e.g. due to limited internet access, not speaking the ‘right’ language or facing a paywall) means one cannot access that action (consider today’s eBay and Ticketmaster bots). Communication with many utility or commercial providers currently requires (at least initial) interaction with their artificial agents (Schwerin, 2023; Verma, 2023a). It is not difficult to imagine a future in which a user needs an advanced AI assistant to interface with a more consequential resource, such as their hospital for appointments or their phone company to obtain service. Cases of inequitable performance, where the assistant systematically performs less well for certain communities (situation type 2), could impose serious costs on people in these contexts. Moreover, advanced AI assistants are expected to be designed to act in line with user expectations. When acting on the user’s behalf, an assistant will need to infer aspects of what the user wants. This process may involve interpretation to decide between various sources of information (e.g. stated preferences and inference based on past feedback or user behaviour) (see Chapter 5). However, cultural differences will also likely affect the system’s ability to make an accurate inference. Notably, the greater the cultural divide, say between that of the developers and the data on which the agent was trained and evaluated on, and that of the user, the harder it will be to make reliable inferences about user wants (e.g. Beede et al., 2020; Widner et al., 2023), and greater the likelihood of performance failures or value misalignment (see Chapter 11). This inference gap could make many forms of indirect opportunity inaccessible, and as past history indicates, there is the risk that harms associated with these unknowns may disproportionately fall upon those already marginalised in the design process.""",,153,,3 - Other,3 - Other,3 - Other,6.

The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Gabriel2024,24.10.04,24,10,4,,Risk Sub-Category,Access and Opportunity risks,Emergent access risks,"""Emergent access risks are most likely to arise when current and novel capabilities are combined. Emergent risks can be difficult to foresee fully (Ovadya and Whittlestone, 2019; Prunkl et al., 2021) due to the novelty of the technology (see Chapter 1) and the biases of those who engage in product design or foresight processes D’Ignazio and Klein (2020). Indeed, people who occupy relatively advantaged social, educational and economic positions in society are often poorly equipped to foresee and prevent harm because they are disconnected from lived experiences of those who would be affected. Drawing upon access concerns that surround existing technologies, we anticipate three possible trends: • Trend 1: Technology as societal infrastructure. If advanced AI assistants are adopted by organisations or governments in domains affecting material well-being, ‘opting out’ may no longer be a real option for people who want to continue to participate meaningfully in society. Indeed, if this trend holds, there could be serious consequences for communities with no access to AI assistants or who only have access to less capable systems (see also Chapter 14). For example, if advanced AI assistants gate access to information and resources, these resources could become inaccessible for people with limited knowledge of how to use these systems, reflecting the skill-based dimension of digital inequality (van Dijk, 2006). Addressing these questions involves reaching beyond technical and logistical access considerations – and expanding the scope of consideration to enable full engagement and inclusion for differently situated communities. • Trend 2: Exacerbating social and economic inequalities. Technologies are not distinct from but embedded within wider sociopolitical assemblages (Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1998, 2016). If advanced AI assistants are institutionalised and adopted at scale without proper foresight and mitigation measures in place, then they are likely to scale or exacerbate inequalities that already exist within the sociocultural context in which the system is used (Bauer and Lizotte, 2021; Zajko, 2022). If the historical record is anything to go by, the performance inequities evidenced by advanced AI assistants could mirror social hierarchies around gender, race, disability and culture, among others – asymmetries that deserve deeper consideration and need to be significantly addressed (e.g. Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018). • Trend 3: Rendering more urgent responsible AI development and deployment practices, such as those supporting the development of technologies that perform fairly and are accountable to a wide range of parties. As Corbett and Denton (2023, 1629) argue: ‘The impacts of achieving [accountability and fairness] in almost any situation immediately improves the conditions of people’s lives and better society’. However, many approaches to developing AI systems, including assistants, pay little attention to how context shapes what accountability or fairness means (Sartori and Theodorou, 2022), or how these concepts can be put in service of addressing inequalities related to motivational access (e.g. wanting/trust in technology) or use (e.g. different ways to use a technology) (van Dijk, 2006). Advanced AI assistants are complex technologies that will enable a plurality of data and content flows that necessitate in-depth analysis of social impacts. As many sociotechnical and responsible AI practices were developed for conventional ML technologies, it may be necessary to develop new frameworks, approaches and tactics (see Chapter 19).

Increasingly agentic AI assistants trained using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and with the ability to access and analyse users’ behavioural data, for example, may learn to tailor their responses to users’ preferences and feedback. In doing so, these systems could end up producing partial or ideologically biased statements in an attempt to conform to user expectations, desires or preferences for a particular worldview (Carroll et al., 2022). Over time, this could lead AI assistants to inadvertently reinforce people’s tendency to interpret information in a way that supports their own prior beliefs (‘confirmation bias’), thus making them more entrenched in their own views and more resistant to factual corrections (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). At the societal level, this could also exacerbate the problem of epistemic fragmentation – a breakdown of shared knowledge, where individuals have conflicting understandings of reality and do not share or engage with each other’s beliefs – and further entrench specific ideologies. Excessive trust and overreliance on hyperpersonalised AI assistants could become especially problematic if people ended up deferring entirely to these systems to perform tasks in domains they do not have expertise in or to take consequential decisions on their behalf (see Chapter 12). For example, people may entrust an advanced AI assistant that is familiar with their political views and personal preferences to help them find trusted election information, guide them through their political choices or even vote on their behalf, even if doing so might go against their own or society’s best interests. In the more extreme cases, these developments may hamper the normal functioning of democracies, by decreasing people’s civic competency and reducing their willingness and ability to engage in productive political debate and to participate in public life (Sullivan and Transue, 1999).""",,162,,2 - AI,2 - Unintentional,2 - Post-deployment,3.

One concern is that it could result in a degradation of the quality of the information available online. Researchers have already observed an uptick in the amount of audiovisual misinformation, elaborate scams and fake websites created using generative AI tools (Hanley and Durumeric, 2023). As more and more people turn to AI assistants to autonomously create and disseminate information to public audiences at scale, it may become increasingly difficult to parse and verify reliable information. This could further threaten and complicate the status of journalists, subject-matter experts and public information sources. Over time, a proliferation of spam, misleading or low-quality synthetic content in online spaces could also erode the digital knowledge commons – the shared knowledge resources accessible to everyone on the web, such as publicly accessible data repositories (Huang and Siddarth, 2023). At its extreme, such degradation could also end up skewing people’s view of reality and scientific consensus, make them more doubtful of the credibility of all information they encounter and shape public discourse in unproductive ways. Moreover, in an online environment saturated with AI-generated content, more and more people may become reliant on personalised, highly capable AI assistants for their informational needs.

Studies show that spreaders of disinformation tend to privilege quantity over quality of messaging, flooding online spaces repeatedly with misleading content to sow ‘seeds of doubt’ (Hassoun et al., 2023). Research on the ‘continued influence effect’ also shows that repeatedly being exposed to false information is more likely to influence someone’s thoughts than a single exposure. Studies show, for example, that repeated exposure to false information makes people more likely to believe it by increasing perceived social consensus, and it makes people more resistant to changing their minds even after being given a correction (for a review of these effects, see Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Ecker et al., 2022). By leveraging the frequent and personalised nature of repeated interactions with an AI assistant, malicious actors could therefore gradually nudge voters towards a particular viewpoint or sets of beliefs over time (see Chapters 8 and 9). Propagandists could also use AI assistants to make their disinformation campaigns more personalised and effective. There is growing evidence that AI-generated outputs are as persuasive as human arguments and have the potential to change people’s minds on hot-button issues (Bai et al., 2023; Myers, 2023). Recent research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed that LLMs could be successfully prompted to generate ‘persuasive misinformation’ in 78 out of 100 test cases, including content denying climate change (see Chapters 9 and 18). If compromised by malicious actors, in the future, highly capable and autonomous AI assistants could therefore be programmed to run astroturfing campaigns autonomously, tailor misinformation content to users in a hyperprecise way, by preying on their emotions and vulnerabilities, or to accelerate lobbying activities (Kreps and Kriner, 2023). As a result, people may be misled into believing that content produced by weaponised AI assistants came from genuine or authoritative sources. Covert influence operations of this kind may also be harder to detect than traditional disinformation campaigns, as virtual assistants primarily interact with users on a one-to-one basis and continuously generate new content (Goldstein et al., 2023).""",,163,,1 - Human,1 - Intentional,2 - Post-deployment,4.

Reliability is a foundational requirement because unreliable outputs would negatively impact almost all LLM applications, especially ones used in high-stake sectors such as health-care [43, 44, 45] and finance [46, 47]. The meaning of reliability is many-sided. For example, for factual claims such as historical events and scientific facts, the model should give a clear and correct answer. This is important to avoid spreading misinformation and build user trust. Going beyond factual claims, making sure LLMs do not hallucinate or make up factually wrong claims with confidence is another important goal.

The language models’ ability to understand or generate harmful or offensive content is referred to as toxicity (Zhuo et al., 2023). Toxicity can bring harm to society and damage the harmony of the community. Hence, it is crucial to ensure that harmful or offensive information is not present in the training data and is removed if they are. Similarly, the training data should be free of pornographic, sexual, or erotic content (Zhuo et al., 2023).

Biases of different forms are sometimes observed in the content generated by language models, which could be an outcome of the training data. For example, exclusionary norms occur when the training data represents only a fraction of the population (Zhuo et al., 2023). Similarly, monolingual bias in multilingualism arises when the training data is in one single language (Weidinger et al., 2021). As ChatGPT is operating across the world, cultural sensitivities to different regions are crucial to avoid biases (Dwivedi et al., 2023). When AI is used to assist in decision-making across different stages of employment, biases and opacity may exist (Chan, 2022). Stereotypes about specific genders, sexual orientations, races, or occupations are common in recommendations offered by generative AI. Hence, the representativeness, completeness, and diversity of the training data are essential to ensure fairness and avoid biases (Gonzalez, 2023). The use of synthetic data for training can increase the diversity of the dataset and address issues with sample-selection biases in the dataset (owing to class imbalances) (Chen et al., 2021). Generative AI applications should be tested and evaluated by a diverse group of users and subject experts.

A prominent field that faces the threat of misuse is education. Cotton et al. (2023) have raised concerns over academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT. ChatGPT can be used as a high-tech plagiarism tool that identifies patterns from large corpora to generate content (Gefen & Arinze, 2023). Given that generative AI such as ChatGPT can generate high-quality answers within seconds, unmotivated students may not devote time and effort to work on their assignments and essays. Hence, in the era of generative AI, the originality of the work done by students could be difficult to assess. Text written by ChatGPT is regarded as plagiarism and is not acceptable (Thorp, 2023). Another form of misuse is cheating in examinations. If students have access to digital devices during examinations, they can resort to using ChatGPT to assist them in answering the questions. To address potential misuse in education, AI-generated content detectors such as Turnitin could be used and strict proctoring measures will need to be deployed (Susnjak, 2022).

Privacy relates to sensitive personal information that owners do not want to disclose to others (Fang et al., 2017). Data security refers to the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft. In the development stage of ChatGPT, a huge amount of personal and private data was used to train it, which threatens privacy (Siau & Wang, 2020). As ChatGPT increases in popularity and usage, it penetrates people’s daily lives and provides greater convenience to them while capturing a plethora of personal information about them. The concerns and accompanying risks are that private information could be exposed to the public, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, it has been reported that the chat records of some users have become viewable to others due to system errors in ChatGPT (Porter, 2023). Not only individual users but major corporations or governmental agencies are also facing information privacy and security issues.

Economies of scale allow bigger AI companies to spread one- off development costs over an ever- larger customer base, creating a cost advantage over smaller companies. Network effects further allow larger companies to train future models with user data generated through older models.""",,123,,,,,

If these goals are distorted or corrupted, then this can lead to worse outcomes for the delegating agent(s) (Nguyen et al., 2024b; Sourbut et al., 2024).
