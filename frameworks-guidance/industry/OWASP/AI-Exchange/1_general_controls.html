AI programs have additional concerns around privacy and security that need to be considered. While each system implementation will be different based on its contextual purpose, the same process can be applied.

This means that data science development activities should become part of your secure software development practices. Examples of these practices: secure development training, code review, security requirements, secure coding guidelines, threat modeling (including AI-specific threats), static analysis tooling, dynamic analysis tooling, and penetration testing. There is no need for an isolated secure development framework for AI.</p><p>Particularities for AI in secure software development:</p><ul><li>AI teams (e.g. data scientists) need to be taken into scope of your secure development activities, for them to address both conventional security threats and AI-specific threats, applying both conventional security controls and AI-specific ones. Typically, technical teams depend on the AI engineers when it comes to the AI-specific controls as they mostly require deep AI expertise. For example: if training data is confidential and collected in a distributed way, then a federated learning approach may be considered.</li><li>AI security assets, threats and controls (as covered in this document) need to be considered, effecting requirements, policies, coding guidelines, training, tooling, testing practices and more. Ususally, this is done by adding these elements in the organizations Information Security Management System, as described in <a href=/goto/segprogram/>SECPROGRAM</a>, and align secure software development to that - just like it has been aligned on the conventional assets, threats and controls.</li><li>Apart from software components, the supply chain for AI can also include data and models which may have been poisoned, which is why data provenance and model management are central in <a href=/goto/supplychainmanage/>AI supply chain management</a>.</li><li>In AI, software components can also run in the development environment instead of in production, for example to train models, which increases the attack surface e.g. malicious development components attacking training data.</li></ul><p>AI-specific elements in the development environment (sometimes referred to as MLops):</p><ul><li>Supply chain management of data and models, including provenance of the internal processes (for data this effectively means data governance)</li><li>In addition supply chain management: integrity checks on elements that can have been poisoned (data, models), using an internal or external signed registry for example</li><li>Static code analysis<ul><li>Running big data/AI technology-specific static analysis rules (e.g the typical mistake of creating a new dataframe in Python without assigning it to a new one)</li><li>Running maintainability analysis on code, as data and model engineering code is typically hindered by code quality issues</li><li>Evaluating code for the percentage of code for automated testing. Industry average is 43% (SIG benchmark report 2023). An often cited recommendation is 80%.

Apply general (not just security-oriented) software engineering best practices to AI development.</p><p>Data scientists are focused on creating working models, not on creating future-proof software per se. Often, organizations already have software practices and processes in place. It is important to extend these to AI development, instead of treating AI as something that requires a separate approach. Do not isolate AI engineering. This includes automated testing, code quality, documentation, and versioning. ISO/IEC 5338 explains how to make these practices work for AI.</p><p>Purpose: This way, AI systems will become easier to maintain, transferable, secure, more reliable, and future-proof.</p><p>A best practice is to mix data scientist profiles with software engineering profiles in teams, as software engineers typically need to learn more about data science, and data scientists generally need to learn more about creating future-proof, maintainable, and easily testable code.</p><p>Another best practice is to continuously measure quality aspects of data science code (maintainability, test code coverage), and provide coaching to data scientists in how to manage those quality levels.</p><p>Apart from conventional software best practices, there are important AI-specific engineering practices, including for example data provenance & lineage, model traceability and AI-specific testing such as continuous validation, testing for model staleness and concept drift.

If personal data is involved and/or AI is applied to make decisions about individuals, then privacy laws and regulations are also in scope. See the <a href=https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/ target=_blank rel=noopener>OWASP AI Guide</a> for privacy aspects of AI.<br>Compliance as a goal can be a powerful driver for organizations to grow their readiness for AI. While doing this it is important to keep in mind that legislation has a scope that does not necessarily include all the relevant risks for the organization.

Even if someone&rsquo;s identity can be guessed from data with some certainty, it can be harmful. The concept of <em>differential privacy</em> helps to analyse the level of anonymity. It is a framework for formalizing privacy in statistical and data analysis, ensuring that the privacy of individual data entries in a database is protected. The key idea is to make it possible to learn about the population as a whole while providing strong guarantees that the presence or absence of any single individual in the dataset does not significantly affect the outcome of any analysis. This is often achieved by adding a controlled amount of random noise to the results of queries on the database. This noise is carefully calibrated to mask the contribution of individual data points, which means that the output of a data analysis (or query) should be essentially the same, whether any individual&rsquo;s data is included in the dataset or not. In other words by observing the output, one should not be able to infer whether any specific individual&rsquo;s data was used in the computation.</p><p>Distorting training data can make it effectively uncrecognizable, which of course needs to be weighed against the inaccuracy that this typically creates. See also <a href=/goto/traindatadistortion/>TRAINDATADISTORTION</a> which is about distortion against data poisoning and <a href=/goto/evasionrobustmodel/>EVASIONROBUSTMODEL</a> for distortion against evasion attacks. Together with this control OBFUSCATETRAININGDATA, these are all approaches that distort training data, but for different purposes.</p><p><strong>Examples of approaches are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE)</p><p>Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique. This method tackles the challenge of training models on sensitive data while maintaining privacy. It achieves this by employing an ensemble of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; models along with a &ldquo;student&rdquo; model. Each teacher model is independently trained on distinct subsets of sensitive data, ensuring that there is no overlap in the training data between any pair of teachers. Since no single model sees the entire dataset, it reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information. Once the teacher models are trained, they are used to make predictions. When a new (unseen) data point is presented, each teacher model gives its prediction. These predictions are then aggregated to reach a consensus. This consensus is considered more reliable and less prone to individual biases or overfitting to their respective training subsets. To further enhance privacy, noise is added to the aggregated predictions. By adding noise, the method ensures that the final output doesn&rsquo;t reveal specifics about the training data of any individual teacher model. The student model is trained not on the original sensitive data, but on the aggregated and noised predictions of the teacher models. Essentially, the student learns from the collective wisdom and privacy-preserving outputs of the teachers. This way, the student model can make accurate predictions without ever directly accessing the sensitive data. However, there are challenges in balancing the amount of noise (for privacy) and the accuracy of the student model. Too much noise can degrade the performance of the student model, while too little might compromise privacy.</p><p>References:</p><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05157 target=_blank rel=noopener>SF-PATE: Scalable, Fair, and Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Objective function perturbation</p><p>Objective function perturbation is a differential privacy technique used to train machine learning models while maintaining data privacy. It involves the intentional introduction of a controlled amount of noise into the learning algorithm’s objective function, which is a measure of the discrepancy between a model’s predictions and the actual results. The perturbation, or slight modification, involves adding noise to the objective function, resulting in a final model that doesn’t exactly fit the original data, thereby preserving privacy. The added noise is typically calibrated to the objective function’s sensitivity to individual data points and the desired privacy level, as quantified by parameters like epsilon in differential privacy. This ensures that the trained model doesn’t reveal sensitive information about any individual data point in the training dataset. The main challenge in objective function perturbation is balancing data privacy with the accuracy of the resulting model. Increasing the noise enhances privacy but can degrade the model’s accuracy. The goal is to strike an optimal balance where the model remains useful while individual data points stay private.</p><p>References:</p><ul><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01783v1 target=_blank rel=noopener>Differentially Private Objective Perturbation: Beyond Smoothness and Convexity</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Masking</p><p>Masking involves the alteration or replacement of sensitive features within datasets with alternative representations that retain the essential information required for training while obscuring sensitive details. Various methods can be employed for masking, including tokenization, perturbation, generalization, and feature engineering. Tokenization replaces sensitive text data with unique identifiers, while perturbation adds random noise to numerical data to obscure individual values. Generalization involves grouping individuals into broader categories, and feature engineering creates derived features that convey relevant information without revealing sensitive details. Once the sensitive features are masked or transformed, machine learning models can be trained on the modified dataset, ensuring that they learn useful patterns without exposing sensitive information about individuals. However, achieving a balance between preserving privacy and maintaining model utility is crucial, as more aggressive masking techniques may lead to reduced model performance.</p><p>References:</p><ul><li><a href=[https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01783v1]%28https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02185%29>Data Masking with Privacy Guarantees</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Encryption</p><p>Encryption is a fundamental technique for pseudonymization and data protection. It underscores the need for careful implementation of encryption techniques, particularly asymmetric encryption, to achieve robust pseudonymization. Emphasis is placed on the importance of employing randomized encryption schemes, such as Paillier and Elgamal, to ensure unpredictable pseudonyms. Furthermore, homomorphic encryption, which allows computations on ciphertexts without the decryption key, presents potential advantages for cryptographic operations but poses challenges in pseudonymization. The use of asymmetric encryption for outsourcing pseudonymization and the introduction of cryptographic primitives like ring signatures and group pseudonyms in advanced pseudonymization schemes are important.</p><p>There are two models of encryption in machine learning:</p><ol><li>(part of) the data remains in encrypted form for the data scientists all the time, and is only in its original form for a separate group of data engineers, that prepare and then encrypt the data for the data scientists.</li><li>the data is stored and communicated in encrypted form to protect against access from users outside the data scientists, but is used in its original form when analysed, and transformed by the data scientists and the model. In the second model it is important to combine the encryption with proper access control, because it hardly offers protection to encrypt data in a database and then allow any user access to that data through the database application.</li></ol></li><li><p>Tokenization</p><p>Tokenization is a technique for obfuscating data with the aim of enhancing privacy and security in the training of machine learning models. The objective is to introduce a level of obfuscation to sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of exposing individual details while maintaining the data&rsquo;s utility for model training. In the process of tokenization, sensitive information, such as words or numerical values, is replaced with unique tokens or identifiers. This substitution makes it difficult for unauthorized users to derive meaningful information from the tokenized data.</p><p>Within the realm of personal data protection, tokenization aligns with the principles of differential privacy. When applied to personal information, this technique ensures that individual records remain indiscernible within the training data, thus safeguarding privacy. Differential privacy involves introducing controlled noise or perturbations to the data to prevent the extraction of specific details about any individual.</p><p>Tokenization aligns with this concept by replacing personal details with tokens, increasing the difficulty of linking specific records back to individuals.
Tokenization proves particularly advantageous in development-time data science when handling sensitive datasets. It enhances security by enabling data scientists to work with valuable information without compromising individual privacy. The implementation of tokenization techniques supports the broader objective of obfuscating training data, striking a balance between leveraging valuable data insights and safeguarding the privacy of individuals.</p></li><li><p>Anonymization</p><p>Anonymization is the process of concealing or transforming sensitive information in a dataset to protect individuals&rsquo; privacy and identity. This involves replacing or modifying identifiable elements with generic labels or pseudonyms, aiming to obfuscate data and prevent specific individual identification while maintaining data utility for effective model training. In the broader context of advanced pseudonymization methods, anonymization is crucial for preserving privacy and confidentiality in data analysis and processing.</p><p>Challenges in anonymization include the need for robust techniques to prevent re-identification, limitations of traditional methods, and potential vulnerabilities in achieving true anonymization. There is an intersection with advanced techniques such as encryption, secure multiparty computation, and pseudonyms with proof of ownership.</p><p>In the healthcare sector with personally identifiable information (PII), there are potential pseudonymization options, emphasizing advanced techniques like asymmetric encryption, ring signatures, group pseudonyms and pseudonyms based on multiple identifiers. In the cybersecurity sector, pseudonymization is applied in common use cases, such as telemetry and reputation systems.</p><p>These use cases demonstrate the practical relevance and applicability of pseudonymization techniques in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for stakeholders involved in data pseudonymization and data protection.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Further references:</strong></p><ul><li>Abadi, M., Chu, A., Goodfellow, I., McMahan, H.

There are many ways to prevent and to detect these attacks. This section is about how the effects of unwanted model behaviour can be controlled, in order to reduce the impact of an attack.</p><p>Besides attacks, AI systems can display unwanted behaviour for other reasons, making the control of this behaviour a shared responsibility. Main potential causes of unwanted model behaviour:</p><ul><li>Insufficient or incorrect training data</li><li>Model staleness/ Model drift (i.e. the model becoming outdated)</li><li>Mistakes during model and data engineering</li><li>Security threats: attacks as laid out in this document, e.g. model poisoning, evasion attacks</li></ul><p>Successfully mitigating unwanted model behaviour has its own threats:</p><ul><li>Overreliance: the model is being trusted too much by users</li><li>Excessive agency: the model is being trusted too much by engineers and gets excessive functionality, permissions, or autonomy</li></ul><p>Example: The typical use of plug-ins in Large Language Models (GenAI) presents specific risks concerning the protection and privileges of these plug-ins. This is because they enable Large Language Models (LLMs, a GenAI) to perform actions beyond their normal interactions with users. (<a href=https://llmtop10.com/llm07/ target=_blank rel=noopener>OWASP for LLM 07</a>)</p><p>Example: LLMs (GenAI), just like most AI models, induce their results based on training data, meaning that they can make up things that are false. In addition, the training data can contain false or outdated information. At the same time, LLMs (GenAI) can come across very confident about their output. These aspects make overreliance of LLM (GenAI) (<a href=https://llmtop10.com/llm09/ target=_blank rel=noopener>OWASP for LLM 09</a>) a real risk, plus excessive agency as a result of that (<a href=https://llmtop10.com/llm08/ target=_blank rel=noopener>OWASP for LLM 08</a>).

The properties of wanted or unwanted model behavior often cannot be entirely specified, limiting the effectiveness of guardrails.</p><p><strong>Limitations of human oversight:</strong>
The alternative to guardrails is to apply human oversight. This is of course more costly and slower, but allows for more intelligent validation given the involved common sense and human domain knowledge - provided that the person performing the oversight actually has the required knowledge.
For human operators or drivers of automated systems like self-driving cars, staying actively involved or having a role in the control loop helps maintain situational awareness. This involvement can prevent complacency and ensures that the human operator is ready to take over control if the automated system fails or encounters a scenario it cannot handle. However, maintaining situational awareness can be challenging with high levels of automation due to the &ldquo;out-of-the-loop&rdquo; phenomenon, where the human operator may become disengaged from the task at hand, leading to slower response times or decreased effectiveness in managing unexpected situations.
In other words: If you as a user are not involved actively in performing a task, then you lose understanding of whether it is correct or what the impact can be. If you then only need to confirm something by saying &lsquo;go ahead&rsquo; or &lsquo;cancel&rsquo;, a badly informed &lsquo;go ahead&rsquo; is easy to pick.</p><p>Designing automated systems that require some level of human engagement or regularly update the human operator on the system&rsquo;s status can help maintain situational awareness and ensure safer operations.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Logic preventing the trunk of a car from opening while the car is moving, even if the driver seems to request it</li><li>Requesting user confirmation before sending a large number of emails as instructed by a model</li><li>A special form of guardrails is censoring unwanted output of GenAI models (e.g. violent, unethical)</li><li></li></ul><p>Useful standards include:</p><ul><li>ISO/IEC 42001 B.9.3 defines controls for human oversight and decisions regarding autonomy.
