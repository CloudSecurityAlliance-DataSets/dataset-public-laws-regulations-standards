The CSP owns the control in relation to the entities whose access to the cloud environment the CSP provisions and maintains, including CSP internal users, external users (vendors and customers), applications, and services.\n \n Implementation Guidelines.\n Applicable to all service models:\n Processes, procedures and technical measures for authenticating access to systems, applications and sensitive data should be defined and maintained.\n \n The CSP is responsible for ensuring that non-console administrative access and remote access require MFA.\n \n MFA and digital certificate implementation best practices for sensitive data access include (but are not limited to):\n a. Authentication Management: \n i. A centralized authentication system that can manage identities, authentication credentials, and access control permissions across all cloud services should be implemented\n ii. Users that require privileged access (e.g., administrators and IT staff) should be identified to establish stricter authentication measures\n iii. Specific authentication factors and technical measures should be defined and implemented for each access level, including MFA for privileged identities and sensitive data access\n b. MFA Usage Scope:\n i. Sensitive Data Access: Strong authentication should be enforced at all user accounts, requiring a combination of something the user: Knows (such as a password); Has (such as a mobile device or token); Is (such as biometrics); MFA for all users should be enabled, including non-privileged users who access sensitive data\n ii. Administrative Access: MFA should be enforced for all administrative access (e.g., access to cloud management consoles, virtual machines, remote access gateways, and other critical cloud infrastructure elements). If MFA cannot be implemented in a particular situation, the risk should be formally registered\n iii. Remote Access: MFA should be enforced for all remote access, whether through VPNs, web applications, or mobile devices\n iv. Third-Party Access: MFA should be enforced for third-party access, such as through APIs or cloud services, to protect against unauthorized access by external entities\n c. Second Factor Authentication: Second factor authentication should be leveraged in addition to passwords to add an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor of:\n i. Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) to allow users to generate temporary codes via SMS, email, a smartphone app synchronized with an authentication server\n ii. Hardware tokens or USB keys that generate unique codes for authentication\n d. Passwordless Authentication: Passwordless authentication solutions should be implemented that replace traditional passwords with secure alternatives such as phishing-resistant MFA and FIDO2-compliant security keys or biometrics\n e. Authentication Credentials Protection: All authentication credentials should be transmitted through secure channels (e.g., TLS/HTTPS) and never stored in plaintext but rendered unreadable in storage on all system components using strong cryptography\n f. Authentication Credentials Change Approval: Requests to change or modify authentication credentials (i.e., performing password resets, provisioning new tokens, generating new keys) should be approved only after verification of the user’s identity\n g. Continuous User Authentication (CUA): CUA should be leveraged as a method of maintaining user authentication throughout their session, requiring periodic reauthentication to ensure that the user is still authorized and has not been compromised\n h. Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO should be implemented for accessing multiple services and applications with a single login credential to simplify the authentication process for users\n i. Digital Certificates: Digital certificates should be utilized for authentication and authorization purposes, especially for system identities\n j. CRL and OCSP Checks: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) checks should be implemented to verify the validity and revocation status of digital certificates\n k. Certificate Lifecycle: The lifecycle of digital certificates should be securely managed including issuance, renewal, and revocation\n l. Certificate Storage: Digital certificates should be stored securely, using encryption and access control mechanisms\n m. Authentication Usage Monitoring:\n i. All authentication mechanisms and enabled features should be properly installed, configured, and authentication logs monitored for the desired and expected results\n ii. MFA, credentials, and digital certificate usage patterns should be should be continuously monitored and reviewed to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities or compromises",

All related policies, standards, and procedures should be communicated to all users. Passwords, when used, should be securely managed throughout their usable lifecycle and should follow good password security practices, as mentioned below.\n \n Implementation best practices for secure passwords management include (but are not limited to):\n a. Password Strength Requirements: Password requirements should be enforced according to industry standards to enhance passwords strength and make them more resistant to brute-force attacks\n b. Password Complexity: Password complexity requirements should be implemented\n i. Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters\n ii. Use numbers and special characters\n iii. Avoid easily guessable information, such as common words or patterns\n c. Minimum Password Length: Minimum password length should be set to ensure passwords are not too short and easily compromised\n d. Password History: A password history policy should be enforced and record of previously used passwords should be kept to prevent users from reusing their previous passwords\n e. Password Expiration: A password expiration policy should be enforced and process implemented to encourage frequent password changes\n f. Password Rotation: Users should be encouraged to regularly update their passwords, balanced with the need for strong, unique passwords to avoid predictable patterns\n g. Default Passwords Update: All vendor-supplied default configuration of passwords for identities and accounts should be removed and reset according the organizations password management policy\n h. Passwords Protection: \n i. Strong password hashing algorithms should be used (e.g., PBKDF2 and bcrypt), and when necessary updated (passwords re-hashing), in accordance with the latest (non-deprecated) industry-standards\n ii. A unique “salt” for each password should be generated and combined with the password before hashing to prevent attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) for attacks\n iii. Secure passwords in storage and in transit (especially during the login process) using strong encryption\n i. Password Persistence: \n i. Password persistence should be disabled for client-side applications, preventing passwords from being stored locally on user devices\n ii. Saving passwords in web browsers or email applications should be avoided\n j. Account Lockout Mechanisms: Account lockout mechanisms should be implemented that temporarily restrict access after a certain number of failed authentication attempts\n k. Public Display Prevention: Applications should be configured by default to not display passwords in clear text on any screen (i.e., mask screen display of passwords). A “show password while typing” option should be made available to select\n l. Password Managers: Users should be provided with access to password managers or integrated password storage capabilities to help them generate and manage strong, unique passwords for different accounts\n m. Automated Password Generation: Passwords/passphrases that are automatically chosen should be generated with a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)\n n. Password Reset: \n i. The use of Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) mechanisms where users can independently reset their passwords\n ii. Upon password reset, users should adhere to the organization's password complexity requirements\n iii. Accurate records of all password reset activities should be maintained (e.g., user involved, date and time of the reset, and the reason for the reset)\n iv. Use MFA or other additional verification steps (e.g., in-person/telephone confirmation) for password resets on highly-privileged accounts (e.g., tenant root/admin)\n o. Password Recovery: Secure mechanisms for password recovery should be implemented (e.g., via email, time-limited recovery links)\n p. Passwords Management Monitoring: Monitoring tools should be leveraged to detect and alert on suspicious activities related to password changes or login attempts",

Dynamic RBAC, ABAC and Context-aware access control mechanisms should be implemented to assign users specific roles with defined privileges and permissions as part of the access control decision-making process\n iii. Explicit permissions (read, write, execute) should be assigned to users or groups on individual resources (e.g., files, databases, applications)\n iv. A process to verify that access is authorized before granting permissions should be implemented\n b. Authorization Request and Approval:\n i. Senior management should be informed of a new user request to access a resource, and with sufficient justification, review, approve, and document such request\n ii. Ad-hoc access requests without approvals should not be granted, with exceptions in emergency situations (e.g., resolving a security incident or recovering from a major outage) where they should be approved by senior management\n iii. Two levels of approvals should be required for granting privileged entitlements (i.e., approval of the user's manager or supervisor and of the asset owner should be required)\n iv. Detection mechanisms should be implemented to identify and report any access that is granted without formal approvals\n v. A list of persons who are authorized to approve access types and relevant requests should be documented and maintained\n vi. Access rights should be immediately revoked after the business justification for such access ceases to exist\n c. Authorization Monitoring and Reviews: Authorization mechanisms should be regularly reviewed and updated. Reviews should be conducted on records of identities activity, including access requests, successful and failed login attempts, and resource usage to ensure that only authorized identities have access",
