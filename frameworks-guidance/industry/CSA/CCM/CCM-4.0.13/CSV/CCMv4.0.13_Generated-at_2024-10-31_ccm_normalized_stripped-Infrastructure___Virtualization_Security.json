For PaaS and SaaS, the CSC is abstracted from the VM layer by consuming either a platform or an application, and all policies and procedures are a CSP-owned responsibility.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nIaaS Provider: \nThe CSP is responsible for creating policies and procedures around the infrastructure, virtual machines, and cloud orchestration tools that they use to deliver the service. However, it is not responsible for creating policies and procedures governing the VM instances that the CSC brings into or builds within the IaaS environment. The CSP may choose to share example policies and procedures with the CSC, or offer services to help the CSC build these policies and procedures. The CSP should provide capabilities and/or technology to enable the CSC to apply the policies and procedures - for example the ability to create network security controls to separate individual VM instances from one another - but it's up to the CSC to create the policies and procedures to use these capabilities.\n\nPaaS Provider:\nThe CSP is responsible for implementing and governing the policies and procedures relating to virtualization security. The CSC is not expected to interface with the VMs in a PaaS environment in any way other than consuming the development environment which runs on top of the VMs. Therefore, the CSP should build a policy management and enforcement framework to govern the VM lifecycle, storage, and network security of the VM environment.

For SaaS offerings, this is a CSP-owned control. Communications security should be a standard component of the software application provided, providing a safe environment for the CSC to interact with the SaaS offering. \n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nIaaS Provider:\nThe CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications between the orchestration layer (cloud management platform) and the CSC, and the orchestration layer and the provisioned infrastructure. This should be enforced by the use of secure protocols (TLS/HTTPS), secure APIs, perimeter security controls, and a CSP-provisioned security monitoring capability to identify potential attack vectors. The security architecture protecting the IaaS environment should be well documented, and follow a governed change management process. The configuration and associated documentation should be regularly reviewed at least annually, in order to identify any areas for improvement, or to adapt security policies to address new attack vectors. The CSP should also provide tools (either as part of the service or via a marketplace) to the CSC to enable them to build and design their own communications security architecture, however it is the responsibility of the CSC to deploy and manage the appropriate security controls.\n\nPaaS Provider:\nThe CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications across the infrastructure and the platform that is being delivered as a service to the CSC. This includes the use of secure protocols (TLS/HTTPS) and secure APIs to support the CSC in accessing the platform service, along with perimeter security controls and a monitoring function to identify any potentially malicious activity from outside of the PaaS environment.

Network traffic monitoring and analysis tools should be implemented with capabilities for:\n• Packet capture and analysis\n• Flow monitoring\n• Anomaly detection and behavioral analytics\n• User activity tracking\niii. Monitoring tools should be integrated with SIEM systems for centralized logging and analysis of network traffic\nc. Network Communications Encryption: End-to-end encryption should be implemented to secure data in transit across the network communication channels\ni. Network devices should be configured to enforce strong encryption for specific protocols and ports\nii. VPN tunnels should be utilized for secure communication between isolated network segments\nd. Network Communications Restriction:\ni. Access controls should be defined and enforced using firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), VPNs, and IAM systems\nii. Firewalls should be deployed at key points within your cloud network architecture to act as gateways between internal and external network connections, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined security rules\niii. Firewalls should be configured with granular access control rules, including IP address ranges, protocols, and ports\niv. If the cloud environment requires publicly accessible services like web or email servers, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) should be established, acting as a buffer zone for isolating sensitive internal resources from potential external threats\ne. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): Adopt a zero-trust approach to cloud network access control, assuming that no user or network device is inherently trusted until verified to dynamically enforce access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and context\nf. Network Configurations Review: \ni. The inventory of allowed network services, protocols, ports, and compensating controls, and network security and access control configurations and encryption practices should be reviewed and updated at least annually\nii. The rationale for allowances should be well-justified based on business needs and risk assessments\n\nContainer-Specific Implementation Guidelines.\nNetwork communications justified by the business should be allowed, encrypted, and require authorization. Conversely, unjustified network communications should be disallowed.\n\nContainer application-aware network monitoring tools should be leveraged for:\na. Container Network Surface: Automated determination of proper container networking surfaces, including both inbound ports and process-port bindings\nb.

Dedicated Container Host: hosts that run containers should only run containers and not other apps-such as web servers or databases-outside of containers\nb. Container Host Patch Management: Hosts that run containers should be continuously scanned for vulnerabilities and updated promptly\nc. Hardened Container Host: The host OS should not run unnecessary system services\nd.
