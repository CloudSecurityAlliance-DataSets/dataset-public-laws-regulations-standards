policies and procedures for the application of the Shared Security Responsibility
Model (SSRM) within the organization. Review and update the policies and procedures
at least annually.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC and CSP should independently establish and maintain their own SSRM shared but independent policies and procedures.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The SSRM is pivotal in ensuring comprehensive and effective cybersecurity risk management. The CSC and CSP jointly engage in implementing, managing, and monitoring the cloud services. The various controls (e.g., from the CCM) should be performed by one party or the other, by both parties independently, or by both parties in a dependent manner. 

The SSRM serves as the key mechanism to:
a. comprehensively elaborate the controls necessary to implement, use, manage, and monitor the cloud services in a secure manner
b. establish and document a common agreement between the CSP and CSC about their respective responsibilities and expectations regarding the controls
c. serve as the basis for contractual service agreement and ongoing contractual management and compliance 
d. support effective ongoing control execution, management, monitoring, and assessment activities
e. facilitate rapid and effective IR and management through clear delineation of responsibilities and communication protocols
f. foster transparency regarding responsibilities and relationship expectations

Other parties engaged by the CSP or CSC may also be involved in supporting the delivery of cloud services. For example, a SaaS service provided by one CSP may involve the use of another CSP to provide underlying IaaS services. The security responsibilities of any supporting service providers in the supply chain should also be reflected in the SSRM.

Given the SSRM's critical role in supporting effective cloud security practices, the CSC and CSP should establish and maintain policies and procedures for the application of the SSRM across their respective cloud services. This ensures consistency and adequate coverage across all services. 

The specific SSRM policies and procedures needed for the CSP or CSC may be influenced by a number of factors. They should align with and augment broader organizational policies and procedures for procurement and contract management, third-party risk management, and cybersecurity risk management to adequately address the unique considerations and risks of cloud services. 

Further, the rigor and comprehensiveness of an organization's SSRM policies and procedures should be commensurate with the risks, complexity, and criticality of the cloud services it uses or provides. For example, the SSRM policies and procedures of a CSC that uses a few non-critical SaaS services do not need to be as extensive and rigorous as a CSC whose business fundamentally relies on extensive IaaS. Additionally, the CSC's expectations for security program management will drive the scope and rigor of the SSRM policies and procedures.

The CSP's policies and procedures should recognize and take into consideration the many CSP- and CSC-specific circumstances that may arise in their cloud service implementations. In particular, exceptions to policies and procedures should be formally managed and approved at the appropriate level of management. This guidance is particularly relevant to contractual commitments between the parties that engender potentially more risk to the CSP or CSC (e.g., compromises a small organization may need to make due to lack of negotiating leverage). 

The SSRM policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with the evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks. Updates should consider and incorporate lessons learned from the CSP's own cloud service implementations, as well as current industry standards and guidance (e.g., current CCM versions and implementation guidelines).  Additionally, if a significantly large, complex, and/or business-critical cloud services implementation is contemplated, the CSP may first want to review existing SSRM policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the anticipated risks and complexity.

The need to implement and maintain SSRM policies and procedures is the same for all cloud service models, however there may be differences in the specific procedures needed for different cloud service models or for specialized cloud services obtained (e.g., IDaaS).  For example, the SSRM procedures employed to manage an IaaS implementation may be more extensive than for a SaaS implementation given the greater responsibilities placed on the CSC under the IaaS model.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. organizational SSRM risk management objectives
b. integration and alignment of SSRM policy and procedures with procurement, legal, third-party risk management, and cyber risk management policies and procedures
c. how the SSRM is integrated and aligned with service contracts
d. roles and responsibilities for SSRM implementation across the cloud implementation lifecycle (i.e., in due diligence, contracting, implementation, management and monitoring, and service termination)
e. definition of risk levels applicable to the extent and rigor of due diligence, management, and monitoring activities and procedures
f. how the SSRM is reviewed, validated, and maintained in collaboration with the CSP over the lifecycle of a cloud service implementation (e.g., by different risk levels)
g. how exceptions to SSRM policy and/or issues and exceptions with respect to the allocation or performance of responsibilities are identified and managed
h. reporting requirements for SSRM program activities and performance
i. approval levels required for SSRM-related decisions

"Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability",SSRM Supply Chain,STA-02,"Apply, document, implement and manage the SSRM throughout the supply
chain for the cloud service offering.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The ownership of this control is ""Shared (Dependent).""  While the initial version of the SSRM is developed by the CSP for its product offering, the finalization, implementation, and management of the SSRM should be performed collaboratively.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CCM control STA-02 is the primary control whereby the SSRM for a given cloud service implementation is documented, implemented, and managed.

SSRM Documentation.  
CCM controls STA-03 and STA-04 provide input to this control in the form of SSRM guidance from the CSP to the CSC (STA-03), and the CSP and CSC working together to specifically delineate control ownership and responsibilities for all CCM controls (STA-04).  

For controls that are CSC-owned, the CSP should provide it with clear and concise guidance on expectations for the CSC's SSRM responsibilities.

For controls that are CSP-owned or ""Shared (Independent),"" the CSP is responsible for documenting those for which they are fully or partially responsible. This documentation is developed under control STA-03 to fully document the service offering and provide SSRM guidance to prospective CSCs. The CSP should specifically document the responsibilities of any third party it has engaged to fulfill a control responsibility. Such documentation should address, in particular, any necessary coordination between the third party, the CSC, and the CSP.

For those controls that are ""Shared (Dependent),"" the CSP should collaborate with the CSC to ensure that each party's responsibilities are fully documented and consistent with the delineation of responsibilities developed under STA-04.

SSRM documentation should also address or reference service level expectations, workload management, contact, escalation, supporting tools, reporting, or other information that may be necessary or helpful in managing the CSC's and CSP's respective responsibilities.

To ensure adequate coverage, all CCM controls should be addressed in the SSRM, even if specifically noted to be not applicable. Further, the delineation of responsibilities in the SSRM should be consistent with any contractual terms agreed to by the parties under STA-09, or may be incorporated directly or by reference in the contract. The CSC and CSP may defer documenting certain details of the SSRM until after the contract is executed or the service is implemented, however, the SSRM should always remain consistent with the contractual agreement.  

SSRM Implementation and Management.  
Once agreed to by the CSP and CSC, the SSRM for a given cloud service implementation guides many aspects of the ongoing relationship.  

Each party is responsible for implementing, managing, monitoring, and auditing their respective responsibilities for each CCM control as delineated in the SSRM (see STA-06). If questions or issues arise regarding control responsibility, the SSRM and contract agreement should be consulted to address and resolve any ambiguities. The CSP and CSC should review their supply chain agreement, and the associated SSRM for the services, at least annually (see STA-10). The SSRM should be updated as necessary to address any changes or clarifications in the shared security responsibilities. If an SSRM requires an update, the CSP should determine if the update is specific to a given CSC implementation, or if the SSRM for the service offering at large should be updated (see STA-03).

The CSP may choose to implement automated tools or reporting to facilitate the ongoing monitoring and management of the SSRM or the underlying service's controls.

The need for the CSP and CSC to document, implement, and maintain the SSRM for a cloud service implementation remains the same for all cloud service models. However, the specifics of each SSRM could change from implementation to implementation.

Applicable to all service models:

SSRM Guidance Documentation.  
The CSP should develop SSRM guidance documentation for each cloud service offering. The documentation should demonstrate the CSP's transparency to the CSC, and clearly articulate expectations for the security responsibilities expected of the CSC.  

The SSRM guidance should detail the CSP's responsibilities with respect to each control for the service offering, as well as the responsibilities that need to be undertaken by any third party in the CSP's supply chain. The guidance should be as detailed and unambiguous as possible, particularly where a control has a shared responsibility between the CSP and its supply chain.  

The SSRM guidance should also detail the CSP's expectations to be undertaken by the CSC (or, possibly, by the CSC's supply chain). The guidance should detail the controls where the CSC is expected to be fully responsible, as well as the controls where there is a shared responsibility with the CSP.  For areas of shared responsibility, the CSP should provide any expectations for how that shared responsibility will be undertaken and managed.  

The below responsibility designations should be documented for each control in the SSRM, and for each cloud service model, as:
a. CSP-Owned: The CSP is fully responsible for implementing, managing, and assessing the control
b. CSC-Owned: The CSC is fully responsible for implementing, managing, and assessing the control
c. Shared (Independent): The CSP and CSC both need to implement the control, but their implementations are independent of one another
d. Shared (Dependent): The CSP and CSC have joint responsibilities for the implementation, management, and assessment of the control

For some service offerings there may be controls where the CSP undertakes responsibility on a conditional basis or for an additional fee. For example, the CSP may offer backup services as an additional service offering. Any such contingent services or areas where SSRM responsibilities may be determined at a later time should be clear in the SSRM guidance.

The CAIQ provides a thorough and convenient means for CSPs to document the SSRM ownership of the controls for its cloud service offerings. The SSRM product offering guidance may additionally reference other control or product documentation, service level objectives, test or assessment results, compliance mappings, etc.

Providing Guidance to the CSC.  
The CSP should provide the SSRM guidance documentation to the prospective CSC. It serves as the basis for the detailed review of SSRM responsibilities between the CSP and the CSC under control STA-05. The documentation may be augmented by other product information, CSP organizational information, technical presentations, sales presentations, etc. over the sales cycle.

The SSRM guidance provided to the CSC is a key component in ensuring transparency and in avoiding later issues related to service responsibilities or contractual terms.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP and CSC should independently and jointly review the SSRM documentation and guidance for each cloud service implementation. For the CSP, these reviews should include any cloud services used for delivering services to the CSC, as well as cloud services used for internal organizational purposes (e.g., cloud-based financial or HR applications).  

The SSRM guidance for the cloud service offering under STA-03 and STA-04 should provide the basis for initial review. The CSC should request joint meetings to clarify any questions the CSC may have about control implementation and responsibilities. The CSP should use this feedback to adjust and improve its cloud service SSRM guidance.

The SSRM review should focus particularly on controls designated as ""Shared (Dependent)"" in the SSRM.  Both parties should ensure that they are clear on their respective responsibilities for coordinated operations.  

The review may also include discussion of any controls offered on an optional basis by the CSP. The CSP should clearly inform the CSC of additional fees or conditions of such optional services.

The SSRM should be updated to reflect any changes warranted by the review.  As needed, the cloud service contract agreement should be updated (under control STA-10) to reflect the change. It is important that the SSRM documentation and contract agreement are aligned and consistent with each other.

"Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability",SSRM Control Implementation,STA-06,"Implement, operate, and audit or assess the portions of the SSRM
which the organization is responsible for.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation and ongoing operation of the SSRM is a shared activity between the CSC and CSP.  

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:

SSRM Implementation. 
Once the SSRM has been agreed upon by the CSC and CSP, and a contract agreement is in place, they should begin the implementation of the control environment for the cloud service. The relevant controls should be designed in as the cloud service is built, and tested iteratively as components are put into service.  

As is documented in the SSRM, some CCM controls may be implemented independently by the CSP and CSC.  

It is important that the CSP and CSC coordinate and collaborate on the implementation of the controls that are identified as ""Shared (Dependent)"" in the SSRM. These controls may require some degree of coordination over the course of time, so it is important that the design and operation of the controls are well understood by both parties from the onset.

SSRM Operation.  
As the cloud service is in operation, the CSP and CSC are each responsible for the operation of the controls assigned to them in the SSRM. The controls identified as ""Shared (Dependent)"" are operated jointly as agreed by the parties. The ""-01"" controls for each of the  CCM domains describe the control policies and procedures that should guide control operation.

SSRM Management, Monitoring, and Audit. 
The implementation, operation, and management of the controls should be monitored on an ongoing basis. Additionally, the controls should be audited periodically by an independent audit group within the organization (i.e., a third-line function) and/or an external audit firm. Control design and operation may also be reviewed by an internal enterprise risk management group (i.e., a second-line function).  

The Audit and Assurance (A&A) domain provides guidance on control audit programs. Additionally, the CAIQ provides a sound basis for establishing an assessment regimen.

The CSP should expect to share the results of security assessments with both prospective and existing CSCs. The specific information should be agreed to in contracts. Control STA-10 describes the ongoing joint review of the SSRM and contract compliance for an existing cloud service implementation. Controls STA-08, STA-13, and STA-14 further describe ongoing review by the CSC. These reviews provide the opportunity to determine if changes to either the SSRM or contract are warranted.

"Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability",Supply Chain Inventory,STA-07,"Develop and maintain an inventory of all supply chain relationships.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control is independently implemented by the CSP and CSC.  Each party's supply chain inventory and inventory management practices are independent of the other.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should establish and maintain an inventory of all supply chain relationships. This inventory can be used to support various supply chain management activities including:
a. recurring due diligence review scheduling and coordination
b. management of contractual and legal matters (e.g., renewals, notices, disputes)
c. ongoing management of the SSRM
d. supply chain risk management program reporting to management
e. management of licenses
f. BIA for the business continuity management program
g. communication, coordination, and escalation during cybersecurity or availability incidents
h. analysis of supply chain aggregate and concentration risk

The supply chain inventory should generally track the following key information, as needed, in support of the above activities:
a. internal and supplier contacts (e.g., business owner, relationship manager, legal, technical, support services, emergency)
b. supplier risk ranking
c. general contract terms (e.g., contract duration, renewal dates, termination dates, etc.)
d. license counts or use restrictions
e. key business process support or dependency information (e.g., in support of BIA)
f. ongoing requirements and schedules for due diligence, periodic reviews, and monitoring

The CSP may choose to ""risk rank"" or create a risk-based classification scheme for their suppliers. Risk ranking of suppliers facilitates determining the appropriate level of effort and comprehensiveness for supplier due diligence and ongoing management and monitoring activities.  Risk ranking of suppliers also supports analyses of aggregate supply chain risk.

The CSP may implement practices for identifying, or incorporating, supply chain relationships that are established outside of normal organizational procurement practices (so-called ""shadow"" purchases of products or services).  

Maintenance of the supply chain inventory should be embedded in procurement and supplier security management procedures, and responsibilities for inventory maintenance should be clearly established. The inventory should be updated at various key points over the life cycle of the supplier relationship, including contract termination.  The inventory should be reviewed and updated, if necessary, at least annually.

","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control is independently implemented by the CSP and CSC.  Each party's review of its own supply chain risks is independent of the other.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Supply chain risk is significant for most organizations. The assessment and management of these risks is not complete when the contract with a supplier is signed. There should be an ongoing program in place to monitor and manage supply chain risk.

The policies, procedures, and results from reviewing CSP supply chain risk will be the subject of initial due diligence reviews by the prospective CSC. The CSP should be transparent in these practices.

The CSP should implement procedures, and allocate sufficient resources with the requisite knowledge and experience, to manage and monitor their supply chain relationships to a degree and extent commensurate with criticality (reference control STA-07). 

Examples of supplier risk factors that should be assessed on a periodic basis include:
a. changes in a supplier's business posture that could pose adverse risk to the organization (e.g., financial condition, reputation, adverse news, compliance/regulatory issues, key personnel loss, business relationships, consumer complaints)
b. supplier's financial statements, independent audit reports, pooled/shared assessments, independent control test reports, and internal scorecards and assessments
c. supplier's adherence to service level agreements, product specifications, performance metrics, resource level/skill commitments, and quality expectations
d. Supplier's software supply chain risk management practices for ensuring software integrity, traceability, and provenance (e.g., software build practices, component management, and use of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs))
e. supplier's program and ability to manage its own suppliers and partners (fourth parties) and the risks those fourth parties may pose
f. supplier's or fourth-party foreign-based operations and activities
g. critical dependencies on the supplier that may warrant the development of alternative solutions or exit strategies and plans

Reference controls STA-13 and STA-14 regarding the periodic review of supplier IT governance policies and procedures, and supplier security programs, respectively. Various industry references and standards are available that provide more guidance on ongoing supplier management and monitoring, and for structuring supply chain risk management programs more broadly.

On-site visits and independent audits (if provided for in the contract) may be warranted for suppliers of critical products or services.

Any concerns, contract exceptions, policy exceptions, or other risks identified in the reviews should be reported to the contract owner and other responsible management, as warranted.

In addition to assessing the ongoing risks associated with specific suppliers, It is recommended to periodically evaluate aggregate risk exposure across all suppliers. Such analyses may focus on vendor, nth-party, geographic, foreign-based, or other risk concentration factors and dependencies than span the organization's suppliers.

It is recommended that supply chain risk management activities align and be integrated with broader enterprise risk management programs.

• Incident management and communication procedures
• Right to audit and third party assessment
• Service termination
• Interoperability and portability requirements
• Data privacy
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSC and CSP should jointly negotiate and execute a contractual agreement that addresses the security provisions for the cloud service offering.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
a. General Contract Matters: 
i. The contract for the cloud service offering is the legally binding agreement between the CSC and CSP. It is important that the contract agreement and SSRM are consistent. An expectation established in the SSRM in the sales or due diligence phases leading up to contract may have no force or effect if not captured in the contract. In some cases the SSRM may be included as an exhibit or attachment to the contract. The CSP and CSC should both cross check that all CCM control responsibilities in the SSRM are covered and accurately reflected in the proposed contract.
ii. The contract should cover matters beyond just SSRM and security considerations, such as payment terms, limitations of liability, intellectual property rights, etc. The CSP will generally provide the initial proposed contract document, along with any exhibits and referenced provisions (e.g., service offering descriptions maintained online). The CSC may also have template provisions drafted that address its specific requirements or regulatory expectations. Attorneys (either inside counsel or outside counsel) will likely be involved in the negotiating process and review of the final document before signature. It is advisable to engage legal counsel that has prior experience with cloud service agreements and information security matters.
b. Common SSRM and Security Provisions: Depending on the cloud service model, nature and scope of the specific services involved, and the distribution of security responsibilities, the contract may address many of the CCM control domains. For example, data backup frequency, storage location, and immutability may be addressed for SaaS services or if included in the service offering for IaaS services. Backups may otherwise be the responsibility of the CSC and not specifically addressed in the contract.  

A non-exhaustive list of security provisions that should be addressed in a contract for cloud services include:
a. requirements for HR security practices, to include training and awareness, background checks, termination procedures, insider threat management, etc.
b. SLAs for availability and support response for issues of various types, to include penalties for failure to meet SLAs
c. non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions appropriate to the types and manner of information being shared
d. data protection and data privacy considerations, to include limitations on data storage locations (e.g., cross-border data transfer), environment segregation, CSC segregation, data access, data use, and data disposal
e. requirements for compliance with laws, regulations, standards, or other contracts (e.g., license or subcontract agreements)
f. implementation and maintenance of technical controls, such as logging and monitoring, network service protections, etc.
g. where applicable, requirements for Confidential Computing and workload isolation
h. joint maintenance and monitoring responsibilities for network connections, APIs, data transfer, and access control interfaces
i. responsibilities, communications, and restrictions related to change management
j. clauses for threat and vulnerability management and threat intelligence information exchange
k. requirements for security incident reporting, to include thresholds, minimum timeframes, and escalation paths, as well as expectations for coordination and information sharing in IR
l. maintenance of BC and DR plans by the CSP, periodic recovery plan testing, and any expectations for joint or bilateral testing with the CSC
m. requirements for physical and environmental security, to include the availability of redundant services
n. requirements for the conduct of independent assessments of the CSP's services, rights for CSC audit, and requirements for demonstrating ongoing compliance with the contract's security provisions
o. in alignment with CCM control STA-12, requirements for the CSP to establish and manage the security requirements of its suppliers

","Control Ownership Rationale.
The annual review of the contractual agreement is a shared activity between the CSP and CSC.  

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP and CSC should establish an annual cycle of contract agreement review. This review should consider any issues, risks, or other considerations that may be raised in the ongoing reviews described for controls STA-08 (periodic review of supply chain risk factors), STA-11 (internal control assessments), STA-13 (periodic review of supplier governance policies and procedures), and STA-14 (periodic security assessments).

Any issues of contract non-compliance, inability to meet defined SLAs, or situations where either party's needs or expectations are not fully met should be discussed and resolved. Ongoing reviews provide the opportunity to maintain full transparency in the business relationship.

Reviews should also address changes in either the CSP's or CSC's services or business circumstances that could affect the ongoing relationship. For example, new products or new partnerships may be of interest to the other party.

If required, the contractual agreement should be formally renegotiated and modified to reflect any necessary changes. As warranted, the SSRM should be also updated to reflect any changes made to the contractual agreement to ensure that the two documents remain consistent.

","Control Ownership Rationale.
Both the CSP and CSC should perform independent internal assessments of their control implementations.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP and CSC should establish an ongoing program of internal control assessment.  

The scope and rigor of assessment programs can vary substantially based on the scope and criticality of the cloud service offering, organization size, industry, and regulatory or compliance requirements. Assessment programs may span reviews performed by the security organization (i.e., ""first-line"" program review); reviews performed by an internal, but independent risk management organization (i.e., ""second-line"" program review); and audits performed by internal audit teams or independent auditors (i.e., ""third-line"" program review). The Audit & Assurance (A&A) domain describes recommended audit program controls. The internal program assessment performed under this control should take into consideration the assessment of the CSP's supply chain performed under control STA-14 to obtain a holistic view of the control environment.

Assessment programs may involve a combination of regular, periodic manual control reviews, as well as elements that are continuous or automated in nature. Manual assessment of controls may include various inspection, sampling, and interviewing techniques. Automated controls and control reporting help ensure continuous assurance of control operation, and should be implemented wherever possible.

All controls covered by the SSRM should be included in the assessment, and all components or elements of the cloud service offering, and related activities, should be addressed. The ""-01"" CCM controls for each domain describe the control policies and procedures that should guide the assessment of control design and operating effectiveness. Review of the coverage and adequacy of the policies and procedures should be included in the assessment.  

The CSP may be asked to assist the CSC in their assessment of those controls identified in the SSRM as ""Shared (Dependent)"".  

The need for the CSC and CSP to independently assess their SSRM control programs is the same for all cloud service models.  
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Examine the process for determining the standards and policy that service level agreements must conform to.
2. Examine the process to determine contractual, legal, and technical requirements applicable to service level agreements.
3. Determine if internal assessments are defined, planned, and executed, at least annually.
"
"Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability",Supply Chain Service Agreement Compliance,STA-12,"Implement policies requiring all CSPs throughout the supply chain
to comply with information security, confidentiality, access control, privacy,
audit, personnel policy and service level requirements and standards.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSP and CSC should independently implement policies and contract provisions to require that all organizations in their supply chain implement adequate security program controls related to the cloud service offering.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
All organizations involved, directly or indirectly, in implementing the SSRM controls for the cloud service offering should have sound security programs and practices in place. The CSP and CSC should each have policies in place to establish the security program and security control expectations for their suppliers, and implement those policies in contractual agreements.

Policies should consider both direct and indirect suppliers of services (i.e., third-, fourth-, and nth-party relationships). An example of an indirect relationship that should be considered is where there may be a primary supplier for datacenter infrastructure services, but that supplier outsources facility cleaning services. The background screening requirements for employees performing cleaning services (who have direct physical access to sensitive equipment and data) should be addressed.  

Both the CSP and CSC should include provisions in their supplier contracts that address the supplier's requirements for managing the security of their suppliers. Such contract provisions should address both the initial determination that supplier security programs and practices are in place and adequate (initial due diligence), and also the ongoing management and monitoring of suppliers to confirm ongoing compliance (see control STA-11).  These supplier management contract considerations should be addressed in the performance of control STA-09, where other contract-related security considerations are also addressed.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Examine the policy for incorporation of requirements into contractual documents throughout the CSP's supply chain.
2. Determine if requirements have been incorporated in contracts.
3. Evaluate if the right to audit is protected, where required.

"Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability",Supply Chain Governance Review,STA-13,"Periodically review the organization's supply chain partners' IT
governance policies and procedures.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control should be independently implemented by both the CSC and CSP.  Each party's review of the IT governance policies and procedures of their suppliers is independent of each other.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
As a part of managing the ongoing risks of its supply chain described for control STA-08, the CSP should periodically evaluate the IT governance policies and procedures of their key suppliers. This control should be performed by the CSP in coordination with control STA-08.

IT governance policies and procedures guide, bound, and provide oversight for an organization's overall approach to technology and cybersecurity risk management. It is important that the IT governance practices of the CSP's key suppliers are in alignment with its own needs and the needs of the CSC.

The following supplier IT governance topics may be reviewed periodically by the CSP:
a. requirements for periodic reporting of technology, cybersecurity, and risk matters to the board or governing authority
b. alignment of IT to organizational mission, strategy, and tactical initiatives
c. requirements for the escalation of risk matters to management and the board or governing authority
d. the establishment of a formal risk appetite and risk tolerance by the board or governing authority
e. compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and contractual agreements
f. roles and responsibilities for technology, cybersecurity, and risk management programs
g. coverage and extent of IT policies and procedures
h. alignment with and adherence to industry standards and best practices
i. practices for determining the adequacy of resources (staff and other IT investments)

Reference control STA-08 for related supplier review considerations and the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GOV) control domain for further guidance on IT governance matters.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Examine the policy for  review of supply chain partners governance of IT.
2. Determine if the right to review is incorporated contractually.
3. Evaluate whether such a review cycle is operating within the organization.
"
"Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability",Supply Chain Data Security Assessment,STA-14,"Define and implement a process for conducting security assessments
periodically for all organizations within the supply chain.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control should be independently implemented by both the CSP and CSC.  Each party's review of the security programs of their suppliers is independent of each other.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
As a part of managing the ongoing risks of its supply chain described for control STA-08, the CSP should periodically, or on an ongoing basis, assess the security programs and controls of their suppliers.  

The policies, procedures, and results of ongoing CSP reviews of their supplier's security will, in most circumstances, be the subject of initial due diligence reviews by prospective CSCs, and ongoing due diligence reviews by existing CSC customers. The CSP should be transparent in these practices.

Where possible, the ability for a CSP to assess the security of a supplier's controls should be automated and provided as close to real-time as possible.  Control reporting, alerting mechanisms, and other such continuous control monitoring methods should be built into cloud service or other IT offerings wherever possible. Where a supplier's controls are not automated, or control operation data is not provided proactively by the supplier, periodic manual review and assessment may be required. Such reviews should generally be performed by the CSP in coordination with control STA-08.

The general objectives of the review are to determine if the supplier's security program and practices remain sufficient for the CSP's requirements, and that the supplier is complying with the expectations set forth in the SSRM and in the contract agreement. The reviews should include all direct and indirect suppliers that the CSP relies upon to provide key services (e.g., infrastructure hosting).

The following supplier security program and security control elements may be reviewed periodically by the CSP:
a. security policies, procedures, standards, and ongoing compliance with industry standards and practices
b. the supplier's risk management, risk assessment, control assessment and testing, and exception management procedures
c. documentation and testing of the specific technical controls implemented to support the product or service (e.g., identity and access management, network design and security)
d. configuration control, change management, product lifecycle, and operations policies, procedures, and controls
e. software supply chain risk management practices for ensuring software integrity, traceability, and provenance (e.g., software build practices, component management, and use of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs))
f. the supplier's own supply chain risk management policies and procedures, supplier reviews of their suppliers, and procedures employed by the supplier to manage and monitor their suppliers on an ongoing basis
g. supplier BC program plan, DR procedures, and reports of the testing of IR and recovery plans, to include any bilateral or joint testing with customers
h. threat management, logging, monitoring, and event analysis capabilities and procedures
i. supplier incident management procedures, incident reporting standards, and any provided reports of security or availability incidents
j. supplier human resources management practices, to include its acceptable use policies, insider threat management program, and practices for noncompliance with policies
k. datacenter, environmental, and physical practices and controls
l. privacy and data management policies, procedures, and controls
m.independent security audit practices

The specific elements reviewed will depend on the SSRM, the contract agreement, and the criticality of the product or service offering. A variety of methods of review, assessment, and testing may be employed depending on the level of due diligence required. Reviews may involve on-site visits, reviews of independent audits or assessments provided by the supplier, reviews of shared assessments, reviews of supplier-provided reports and control tests, and direct control testing.

Reference control STA-08 for related supplier review considerations and the policy-relevant controls for each CCM control domain for guidance on specific security control policies and procedures.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Examine the policy related to the security assessments of the supply chain.
2. Examine the policy related to identification of risks related to external parties.
3. Determine if procedures exist for identification of risks related to external parties
4. Evaluate evidence of the conduct of assessments of organizations within the supply chain, periodically as required by the policy.
