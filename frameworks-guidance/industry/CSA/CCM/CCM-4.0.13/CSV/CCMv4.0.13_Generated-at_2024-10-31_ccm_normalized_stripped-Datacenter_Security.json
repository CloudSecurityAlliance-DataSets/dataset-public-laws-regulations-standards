This assessment should take into account the type of CSC data, the potential harm that could be caused if the data were breached, and the legal and regulatory requirements for protecting the data\nc. Automated Tools for Assets Classification: The CSP can use automated tools to help with asset classification and security.

Assets Classification Documentation: The CSP should document the classification of each asset and the security controls that are applied to the asset.

The responsibility of this control implementation is \"Shared Dependent\" since the CSP should enable the CSC to access the catalog of CSP assets that are used to compute and store CSC data. The CSC should be empowered to retrieve the list of assets. It should be within the support of the CSP to assign descriptive metadata (tags) to assets for efficient and timely tracking, cost analysis, access control decisions, and alerting (by automation where applicable).\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nApplicable to all service models:\nThe CSP should employ a comprehensive solution (e.g., CMDB) for tracking inventory and managing the physical locations of servers and other data center assets, while phasing out paper-based and manual processes. A hosted asset tracking solution for servers, switches, datacenter asset tracking, and racks usually leverages a combination of technologies, such as passive radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning system (GPS),  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and/or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with hardware roots-of-trust (HROT).\n\nThe CSP should maintain a list of assets the CSC is using (e.g., cloud storage) or has provisioned (e.g., VMs) and provide tools to the CSC to access the CMDB and help it identify and tag the assets that handle CSC data. For instance, the CSP should share information about the assets that are used to store the CSC's data (as well as the means to access them).\n\nThis information can then be used by the CSC to catalog, tag, and track all the cloud relevant assets and services that are provided by the CSP, and to process and store CSC data (e.g., network, computational, and storage services).\n\nAn EoL (End-of-Life) tracking system for all inventoried assets should be maintained. A process should be established to gather and maintain accurate EoL information for all inventoried assets within the cloud environment (e.g., manufacturer EoL dates for hardware and software, expiration dates for software/services, patch availability timelines). \n\nAutomated EoL notifications within the asset inventory system should be implemented to trigger proactive security measures like scheduling asset retirement, migrating workloads, or disabling vulnerable assets nearing their end-of-life.

A standardized naming convention is the starting point for organizing the cloud-hosted resources. The same naming conventions on tags should be consistently used across multiple CSPs (e.g., multi-cloud environment), and where possible, cloud assets should be tracked by an automated means, allowing for prompt decisions to be made according to them (e.g., access control decisions, monitoring and alerting, accounting).\n\nTemplates for defining a naming and tagging convention for tagging assets are defined by all major CSPs.

Compliance/Regulatory Tag: Indicate compliance with specific regulations or standards\nix. Automation Tag: Indicate whether the asset should be selected for action by scripts, scanners or other form of automation\nx. Active Tag: Designates resources currently in use for production, development, or other relevant purposes\nxi. Deprecated Tag: Designates resources scheduled for retirement or no longer actively used\nb. Cloud Asset Types:\ni. Virtual machines (e.g., VM instances/images, OS name/version),\nii. Virtual networking (e.g., VPC networks and subnets, DNS records, IP addresses),\niii. Databases (e.g., database/SQL servers),\niv. Storage (e.g., block, file, object storage types), \nv. Applications (e.g., custom applications, container images, software licenses)\n\nThe catalog should include all device status changes (e.g., patch levels, lost/decommissioned status, and to whom the asset type is assigned, or approved for BYOD).\n\nCloud asset cataloging and tracking should be prioritized to include the most security-relevant or critical ones followed by the inclusion of remaining asset types that pertain to minimal or no risk.\n\nIf supported by the CSP, automated scans should be made to identify assets that are not tagged or have tagged values not aligned to CSC's tagging rules (e.g., assets tagged or not tagged with a 'classification level' value).\n\nWhen tagging tools are not made available from the CSP, the CSC should proceed with manually tagging and cataloging assets. Easy-to-parse formats (JSON, YAML, XML) should be preferred for more efficient management and maintenance of the catalog.\n\nThe CSC should map security tools to the assets included in the catalog in order to prevent, detect, recover, and respond to security risks that are applicable to them (e.g., use vulnerabilities patching and antivirus tools with VM/OS assets as preventive and detective security controls).\n\nAssets that have been tagged with a 'Security Classification Level' key type should inherit the highest data classification level (high-water mark) value among the different classification levels of data that the particular asset type is destined to use for performing computational, network or storage operations on such data.\n",
