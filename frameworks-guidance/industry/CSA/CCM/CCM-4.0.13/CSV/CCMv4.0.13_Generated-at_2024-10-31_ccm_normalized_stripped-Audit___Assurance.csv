Audit & Assurance,Audit and Assurance Policy and Procedures,A&A-01,"Establish, document, approve, communicate, apply, evaluate and maintain
audit and assurance policies and procedures and standards. Review and update
the policies and procedures at least annually.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and Cloud Service Customer (CSC) are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to independently develop policies and procedures in order to meet their own business needs, audit, assurance, and compliance requirements. 
The CSP's assertion for conducting an audit of its cloud stack does not extend to the CSC's use of the cloud and its compliance requirements to standards and regulatory scope. The CSP's attestation should also consider subservice organizations that it relies upon to provide key services, e.g., infrastructure hosting.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should establish formal policies and procedures based on industry best practices and relevant standards to educate its personnel of the required baseline for information security standards and guidelines. It should establish and document an approved and organized approach to its regulatory and contractual requirements, or security requirements in standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, AICPA TSC (SOC 2), and CSA CCM in order to prepare and plan its audit and assurance activities.

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:
a. Scope and Objectives: 
i. The scope of audit and assurance activities should be defined, including the cloud services, environments, and data to be audited
ii. A risk-based audit plan should be developed that prioritizes areas of highest risk and aligns with the defined business objectives
iii. Authority and accountability for audit completion should be defined, and requirements to comply and/or assist with audits
b. Independent Assessments: Requirements to conduct independent assessments by qualified and independent third-party auditors to evaluate compliance with relevant standards, security policies, legal and contractual requirements
i. Auditors should have least privilege access to only relevant and necessary information and resources allowing to conduct the audit
ii. A conflict of interest policy should be in place to maintain auditors objectivity and independence
c. Risk-Based Planning Assessment: Requirements on evaluating the effectiveness of the CSP's risk-based plans and internal policies in identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks and potential security vulnerabilities within the cloud environment
d. Requirements Compliance:  Requirements for the CSP to verify compliance for its cloud security practices with all applicable standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements, including data privacy laws, industry-specific regulations, and customer contractual obligations that are applicable to the audit
e. Audit Management Process: An audit management process to govern audit planning, execution, and reporting on cloud security audits. This includes defining the scope, frequency, and methodologies for audits, as well as the roles and responsibilities of audit personnel
f. Remediation: A risk-based corrective action plan to address audit findings in a timely and effective manner. The plan should:
i. Structure audit finding reviews, and track any findings
ii. Prioritize findings based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurring, 
iii. Assign clear ownership and timelines for remediation and  track progress towards resolving identified issues
Additionally, the CSP should regularly review and report remediation status to relevant stakeholders
g. Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite
i. An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and procedures
ii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions should be maintained
h. Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders. Communication channels should be established with relevant stakeholders that require record of activities and provide them with reports of audit findings, audit-related issues and remediation strategies
i. Maintenance and Reviews: Audit and assurance policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks
","Cloud Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSC should state within its policies and procedures that the use of CSP services should provide appropriate audit evidence and contractual attestations that the control objectives the CSC requires  are adequately met. The attestation review should also consider subservice organizations that the CSP relies upon to provide key services, e.g., infrastructure hosting. The CSC should understand whether use of the CSP is compliant with the CSC's regulatory and compliance scope. 

Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following: 
The policies provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Examine policy and procedures to confirm content adequacy in terms of purpose, authority and accountability, responsibilities, planning, communication, reporting, and follow-up.
2. Examine audit charter and determine if independence, impartiality, and objectivity are guaranteed.
3. Examine policy and procedures for evidence of review at least annually.
"
Audit & Assurance,Independent Assessments,A&A-02,"Conduct independent audit and assurance assessments according to
relevant standards at least annually.
","Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own regulatory and contractual obligations. The CSP's independent audit and assurance assessments may be utilized to gauge the security posture of its own cloud services' infrastructure.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should regularly conduct independent assurance and audit activities as established by A&A-01. The CSP should also conform and provide a platform to prove that compliance controls are applied and in accordance with relevant standards.
The audit activities may vary in scope to cover more or less specific areas in a rotational time frame to make sure the whole of the organization and its service provisions include at least some audit activities throughout the year.

Audits and assurance in terms of this control could mean:
a. Independent verification of self-assessments 
b. Physical control reviews and evidence-based claim assessments
c. Performance or testing control effectiveness such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and red team exercises

Audit activities should be conducted by a competent independent internal or external party. 

The CSP may choose to implement a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) tool, either its own or a third-party solution, to enhance audit and assurance activities.

The CSP should not rely only on self assessments, internal gap analysis, or any other metrics that are produced by internal auditing, internal scans, etc., since internal self-alerting biases may exist.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.

The CSC should also perform independent assessments of the CSP to demonstrate compliance with the CSC's requirements, consistent with the contractual agreement.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.

The CSC's choice of the cloud service model (e.g., IaaS) and contractual agreement with the CSP determines how much responsibility is required and what is required within its independent audit and assurance activities.
","1. Examine the process to determine standards and regulations applicable to the organization's systems and environments.
2. Determine if the organization maintains and reviews a list of such standards and regulations.
3. Determine if senior management exercises oversight over the independence of the assessment process.
4. Determine if the audit plan is informed by previous assessments, and is scheduled on an annual basis.
"
Audit & Assurance,Risk Based Planning Assessment,A&A-03,"Perform independent audit and assurance assessments according to
risk-based plans and policies.
","Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own risk-based plans and policies, regulatory and contractual obligations. The CSP's independent audit and assurance assessments may be utilized to gauge the security posture of its own cloud services' infrastructure. However, the CSC should also perform independent assessments of the CSP to demonstrate compliance with its own (CSC's) requirements. Both CSP and CSC are responsible for reviewing the impact of changing risks on audit and assurance assessments.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should implement a regime of independent assurance and audit activities using a risk-based approach. The CSP is recommended to adhere to operational activities and procedures in auditing and risk management standards.

Because the CSC will generally need to rely on the independent audits, assessments, and attestations engaged by and for the CSP, the CSP should ensure that the objectives and scopes of the independent assurance activities are clearly defined and that the objectives and scopes are documented and communicated with adequate clarity and specificity to the CSC.

In particular, the CSP's documentation of objectives and scope should be clear, unambiguous, and have specific delineation as to which cloud services, which resources (including data), and which service features and options were assessed. This permits the CSC to adequately and appropriately rely on the assurance activities and reports provided by the CSP.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.
The CSC, if relying on the CSP's controls and assessments, should review their suitability based on its own risks.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSC should implement an effective risk-based internal and external audit scheme. Internal audit risk assessments should be performed by a team internal to the CSC. It should determine priority, details to be considered, frequency of audit, and general risks to which the CSC is exposed. External assessments should be performed by an independent organization.

The CSC's Audit Manager should prepare reports showing the audit scope and cycle. It should work with auditors to evaluate the risks posed to various departments and functions. 

Audits may leverage System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports and others from independent third parties. 

The CSC's deployment model choice is informed by the business needs and the responsibilities it is willing to assume.

When relying on independent audits, assessments, attestations, and other third-party assurances provided by the CSP, the CSC should pay careful attention to the documented objectives and scope to ensure they adequately cover the services consumed by the CSC.

The CSC should perform the following to achieve its obligations within the SSRM:
Conduct independent third-party compliance audit and assurance activities in line with regulations and standards
Regularly update and reassess audit and assurance activities within scope and criteria
","1. Examine the process for determining the risks applicable to the organization's systems and environments.
2. Determine if a list of such risks is maintained and reviewed.
3. Determine if senior management exercises oversight over the applicable risks.
4. Determine if the audit plan is risk-based, and is scheduled on an annual basis.
"
Audit & Assurance,Requirements Compliance,A&A-04,"Verify compliance with all relevant standards, regulations, legal/contractual,
and statutory requirements applicable to the audit.
","Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of this control, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own cloud security, regulatory and contractual requirements. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should conduct audits and assessments against industry standards, regulations and statutory requirements depending on the services and the jurisdictions in which they operate.

The CSP should implement a process to identify and document legal and regulatory requirements that impact its cloud service offering, both within itself and with third-party suppliers that operate on its behalf.

The process should:
a. Cover the jurisdictions, i.e., regions, countries, states, where the organization conducts business
b. Incorporate the following:
i. Security-specific legislations or regulations
ii. Legislations or regulations which has security control implications
c. Identify the regulatory, statutory, contractual, or other compliance requirements to which the cloud service, its associated systems, and its data are subject
d. Identify the respective specific technical and administrative compliance requirements that are required for the data, technology, and processes comprising and supporting the cloud service. In general, this should include:
i. objects and data elements, system settings and capabilities, metadata, events, activities, and processes subject to any special regulatory requirements
ii. what specific requirements apply to objects, system settings, metadata, activity, and processes
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control's implementation responsibility is shared between the CSP and CSC and each party should independently implement it. 
More specifically, the audit of a CSP might cover only a portion of the technology stack used by a CSC. This audit excludes how CSCs utilize the stack, configure services, manage access, monitor service usage, and choose what data to place in the cloud. Consequently, even if the CSP complies with relevant standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements, CSCs still need to assess their own cloud activities for compliance. 
To this end, CSCs should implement suitable controls and processes regardless of whether the CSP demonstrates adherence to the same standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements. Therefore, the CSC should be aware that it should not rely solely on the CSP's independent audits and need to conduct its own audit activities.

Implementation Guidelines.
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Examine the process for determining the standards and regulations applicable to the organization's systems and environments.
2. Examine the process to determine contractual, legal, and technical requirements applicable to the organization's systems and environments.
3. Determine if the organization maintains and reviews a list of relevant standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements. 
4. Determine if senior management exercises oversight over this control specification. 
5. Determine if the audit plan is informed by the list of the organization's requirements.
"
Audit & Assurance,Audit Management Process,A&A-05,"Define and implement an Audit Management process to support audit
planning, risk analysis, security control assessment, conclusion, remediation
schedules, report generation, and review of past reports and supporting evidence.
","Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of an audit management process, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own unique legislative, regulatory and contractual obligations.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should implement an audit plan which covers the frequency and schedule of the audit. It should have both internal and external audit plans. 
A security control assessment plan should be part of internal auditing activities to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended (are effective), and producing the desired outcome.

The purposes of an audit are:
a. Ensure that the policies, standards and procedures relevant to the area are effectively implemented
b. Ensure the effectiveness of risk management implementation
c. Ensure the effectiveness of the controls included in the organizational security program / Information security management system
d. Where appropriate, provide improvement recommendations to overcome deficiencies in implementation
e. Ensure compliance of control implementation with laws and regulations

The CSP should adhere to the following best practices:
f. Ensure the availability of adequate competent personnel
g. Emphasize the importance and benefits of audits
h. Design and implement workflows and timelines
i. Stress the importance of adequate review of audit and other artifacts
j. Utilize the outputs of the review process to assess the effectiveness of the Audit Management process
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control is shared, meaning that the CSP and CSC should independently implement the control requirements. Nevertheless, the CSC should be aware that it should not rely solely on the CSP's independent audits and need to conduct its own audit activities.

Implementation Guidelines.
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Examine policy related to the establishment and conduct of audits.
2. Determine if audit programs are established and aligned to the requirements of the organization, including the audit charter.
3. Determine if the organization upholds the independence of the audit program.
4. Determine if the conduct of audits is defined, approved at the appropriate level, and reviewed for effectiveness.
"
Audit & Assurance,Remediation,A&A-06,"Establish, document, approve, communicate, apply, evaluate and maintain
a risk-based corrective action plan to remediate audit findings, review and
report remediation status to relevant stakeholders.
","Control Ownership Rationale. 
The CSP and the CSC are both responsible for the implementation of a risk-based corrective action plan to remediate audit findings, however each party needs to implement it independently in accordance with their own unique legislative, regulatory and contractual obligations.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP should maintain a Risk Management program to mitigate and manage risk. Management should have a process that requires it to identify risks within its area of responsibility and to implement appropriate measures to address those risks.

Findings of audit and assurance activities should be given due care and attention at the appropriate levels. If a control deficiency (finding) is identified, the deficiency should be evaluated for prioritization. Once prioritized, the appropriate risk treatment should be selected.

Options to treat risks should be clearly defined and evaluated, which could include:
a. Mitigating risk by increasing the effectiveness of controls
b. Mitigating the risk by implementing compensating controls
c. Avoiding all or part of the risk (i.e., deciding not to pursue a particular business initiative)
d. Accepting all or part of the risk

Risk treatment actions should be:
e. documented in an approved risk treatment plan
f. assigned to ensure accountability
g. monitored against agreed upon target dates
h. reported as required by the Organization's Policy

It is important to establish a set of success metrics and routinely  monitor for closure.    
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control is shared, meaning that the CSP and CSC should independently implement the control requirements. However, it is imperative for the CSC to recognize that it may not exclusively depend on the independent audits conducted by the CSP. The CSC should engage in its own remediation activities for audit findings. 
While the CSC may not directly audit CSPs, it retains the authority to exercise the right to audit to the extent stipulated in their contract agreements.
","1. Examine if the outputs of audits are defined by the policy.
2. Determine if the audit findings are reviewed and if appropriate reports are made available to users and senior management.
3. Determine if the identification of risks from audit findings, or changes to them, are made available to users.
4. Determine if corrective actions proposed are planned to align with the organization's risk profile.
5. Determine if a process exists to track changes in risk rating and is used to update risk registers, particularly with regard to residual risk.
6. Examine a sample of proposed corrective actions and determine if they were followed-up in a manner consistent with the organization's policy.
7. Examine audit programs to determine if they are subject to continuous improvement through feedback, review and revisions.
8. Examine if a process exists to review the audit program in light of current and past audits.
