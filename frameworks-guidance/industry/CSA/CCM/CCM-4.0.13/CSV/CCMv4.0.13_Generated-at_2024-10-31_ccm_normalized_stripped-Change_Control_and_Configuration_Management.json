Exception Requests Documentation: Documentation of all exception requests should be mandated, including the nature of the exception, justification for the exception, potential risks, and mitigation measures to provide transparency and accountability for exception management\nd. Exceptions Communication: Exceptions should be communicated to relevant stakeholders promptly, including the change management team, security team, and affected CSCs\ne. Exceptions Rollback Procedures: Rollback procedures should be established for all exceptions, especially those involving critical systems or data\nf. Post-Exception Reviews: Thorough post-exception reviews should be conducted to analyze the root cause of the exception, identify lessons learned, and implement preventive measures to minimize the likelihood of similar incidents in the future\ng. Exception management and Incident Response Integration: Exception management should be integrated with the incident response process to ensure a coordinated response to security incidents or other disruptions that require immediate action\nh. Exception Management Reviews: Exception management procedures should be regularly reviewed and refined based on feedback from post-exception reviews, changes in cloud infrastructure or applications, and evolving security threats\ni. Exception Records Documentation and Maintenance: A centralized repository of exception records should be maintained for the collection and preservation of evidence and chain of custody documentation for incident management analysis purposes, including the nature of the exception, approval details, rollback procedures, and post-exception review findings\n",

All configuration changes to systems should be independently baselined, tested, and approved according to their corporate policies and in line with industry standards.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nApplicable to all service models:\nImplementing a robust process for proactively rolling back changes to a previously known good state in case of errors or security concerns is essential for CSPs to maintain the stability, security, and reliability of their cloud services. \nA well-defined rollback process ensures that changes can be reversed quickly and effectively, minimizing the potential impact of errors or security incidents. The CSC should be notified if deployment of changes fail and if the roll back occurred.\n\nImplementation best practices for this control  include (but are not limited to):\na. Rollback Baseline: \ni. A rollback baseline that includes snapshots, backups and restore points of all critical cloud assets at a known stable state should serve as a reference point for recovery and restoring the environment\nii. Detailed change logs and backups of configurations should be maintained to facilitate rollback procedures\nb. Rollback Process: \ni. Rollback process and supporting procedures should be established that can be implemented quickly and effectively in case of issues\nii. Rollback procedures should include identifying rollback points, triggering rollbacks, and verifying the success of rollbacks\niii. Rollback procedures should be automated whenever possible to minimize the time and effort required to revert changes (automated tools can be used to restore configurations, data, and applications from the rollback baseline)\nc. Rollback Triggers: The triggers for initiating a rollback should be defined, including specific error codes, security alerts, or performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds and should be configurable to align with the CSP's risk tolerance and security policies\nd. Rollback Testing Strategy: Rollback procedures should be regularly tested to ensure they are effective and functioning as intended. Use staging environments or isolated test environments to conduct rollback simulations without impacting production systems\ne. Rollback Procedures Documentation: Rollback procedures should be documented, including the steps involved, the tools used, and the expected outcomes\nf. Rollback and Change Management Integration: Rollback procedures should be integrated with the change management process to ensure that rollback plans are considered during change implementation and that rollback triggers are aligned with change approval processes\ng. Rollback History: A history of rollback events should be maintained, including the date, time, reason for rollback, and the specific changes reverted. This historical data provides valuable insights for identifying patterns, improving rollback procedures, and demonstrating compliance with security regulations\nh. Rollback Procedures Reviews: Rollback procedures should be regularly reviewed and refined based on testing results, feedback from rollback events, and evolving security threats or cloud infrastructure changes\ni. Rollback Simulation Exercises: \ni. Periodic rollback simulation exercises should be conducted to test the effectiveness of rollback procedures and identify areas for improvement\nii. Have a dedicated team responsible for handling change rollbacks and remediation efforts\n",

Examine relevant documentation, observe relevant processes, and/or interview the control owner(s) and/or relevant stakeholders, as needed to ensure that roll back procedures are defined and implemented and determine if the policy control requirements stipulated in the policy have been implemented. Select a sample of changes and examine the change management record to confirm that the change was assessed and included appropriate fallback procedures in the event of a failed change.\n3. Examine measure(s) that evaluate(s) the organization's compliance with the change management policy and determine if these measures are implemented according to policy control requirements.\n4. Obtain and examine supporting documentation maintained as evidence of these metrics, measures, tests, or audits to determine if the office or individual responsible reviews the information and, if issues were identified, they were investigated and corrected.\n"
