Applicable to all service models:
The CSP is responsible for classifying the access type by the risk they pose to their organization and facilitating the review of user's access periodically (frequency determined based on risk level) or when certain specific events occur such as personnel termination or transfer.

To effectively review and validate user access for least privilege and separation of duties, CSPs should implement a comprehensive approach that encompasses implementation best practices, and a risk-based frequency for such reviews:
a. Access Management and Reviews: 
i. Access management processes and records should be centralized to facilitate easier identity access review and reduce the risk of inconsistencies across different cloud systems
ii. Access reviews should be conducted for remediating obsolete, excessive or unnecessary access, to ensure that access rights adhere to roles and responsibilities, least privilege and SoD principles
iii. Access reviews should be automated, if possible, using automated tools and scripts
iv. Reviews of high-risk access configurations, such as administrator accounts and access to sensitive data should be prioritized for scheduling
v. Access reviews should result to a re-approval of the PoLP, SoD or other entitlements that each identity continues to need to fulfill their job responsibilities or denial of any conflicting combinations of entitlements based on the current and future job responsibilities of the user's role
b. Access Reviews Frequency: The frequency of identity access reviews should be commensurate with the organization's risk tolerance and the sensitivity of the data and systems being protected. For high-risk environments, reviews may be conducted on a daily or weekly basis, while less sensitive systems may be reviewed monthly or quarterly
c. Access Review Documentation: The results of access reviews should be documented and records maintained for audit purposes
d. Audit and Logging: Audit and logging capabilities should be implemented to track identity access activities and generate records of who accessed, what resources, and when, facilitating investigations and identifying any suspicious activity
e. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuous monitoring solutions should be implemented to scan for unauthorized or anomalous activities and to detect changes in access patterns, privilege escalation, and other potential security breaches
f. Access Certification: An access certification process should be implemented that requires users to periodically justify their access privileges to ensure that access is still necessary and relevant for their current roles

measures for the segregation of privileged access roles such that administrative
access to data, encryption and key management capabilities and logging capabilities
are distinct and separated.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control's implementation responsibility is ""Shared (Independent)"" since CSP and CSC are both responsible, but also independently manage their respective processes and procedures to maintain SoD between the privileged roles that have administrative access to data or encryption keys, and the roles that have access to logging capabilities (such as logging configuration and log files in storage) that captures the access to the data or the keys. The CSP owns the control in relation to the entities whose access to the cloud environment the CSP provisions and maintains, including CSP internal users, external users (vendors and customers), applications, and services.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP is responsible for ensuring the SoD between the privileged roles that have administrative access to the data, the keys that are used to encrypt the data, and the logging capabilities that capture the access to the data or the keys. The CSP is also responsible to maintain separation of accounts and access permissions between the production and non-production environments to ensure the personnel with access only to the non-production accounts are not able to access the production environment using non-production accounts.

Implementation best practices for the segregation of privileged access roles include (but are not limited to):
a. Privileged Access Roles Segregation:
i. The roles and responsibilities of each privileged identity should be defined ensuring that no single identity holds excessive privileges in order to establish a separation of duties and reduce the risk of misuse
ii. Privileged roles that, if combined, create conflicting combinations of access should be explicitly identified and labeled in PAM systems
iii. The roles and permissions that grant access to non-production environments should be separated from the roles and permissions that grant access to production environments
b. Access Segregation to Different Privileged Areas:
i. Privileged and administrative functions access should be divided into distinct realms, such as administrative access, encryption/key management, configuration changes, and logging, to prevent a single identity from compromising access to all these areas simultaneously
ii. Privileged activities should be isolated within a separate environment or virtual machine, where possible
c. Access Restriction to Sensitive Data and Systems:
i. Access controls should be implemented to restrict privileged users from accessing sensitive systems and data that are not directly related to their job duties (enforce PoLP for privileged accounts)
ii. SSH keys with strong key encryption and rotation should be utilized to authenticate privileged access over SSH connections
d. Privileged Access Segregation Reviews:
i. Access roles with privileged and administrative capabilities should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure proper segregation and within reasonable frequencies specified by the CSP's IAM policy

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The CSP is responsible for ensuring that the activity logs are stored and maintained preferably at a centralized location. Only read-only access should be provisioned to authorized users to prevent log tampering. If privileged access is provisioned to users, the principle of SoD should be followed, and privileged activity should be recorded and reported separately for management review. The logging system should be integrated with a SIEM solution for real-time monitoring and for sending alerts when necessary. Ability to disable the system should be subject to a ""break glass"" procedure, with the principle of SoD duly observed. 

Scope of access control includes general non-privileged users and all privileged users such as: cloud administrators responsible for provisioning and deprovisioning cloud infrastructure resources; security administrators  responsible for developing and implementing security policies and procedures; and system operators responsible for monitoring resource performance and availability, troubleshooting, and resolving operational issues.

Implementation best practices for a CSP to safeguard logs integrity include (but are not limited to):
a. Read-only Access Restriction: Access to logs should be restricted to read-only access at all times and to authorized identities only according to the principle of least privilege
b. Immutable Log Storage:  Immutable log storage solutions (e.g., write-once-read-many (WORM) storage) should be leveraged that prevent modification or deletion of logs once they are created to ensure that logs remain tamper-proof and provide an accurate record of system events
c. Logs Integrity Verification:
i. Data integrity verification techniques should be employed (e.g., cryptographic hash functions) and verification results monitored to identify any inconsistencies or signs of tampering
ii. Procedures should be implemented for handling any discrepancies or anomalies detected during data integrity verification
d. Controlled Read-only Access Disablement:
i. SoD should be employed for disabling read-only access to logs so that the ability to disable read-only access requires collaboration between different users or teams
ii. Identities responsible for disabling read-only access should not have the ability to also modify logs, and vice versa
iii. Access to specific tools or privileged commands that can disable read-only access to logs should be restricted
iv. A multi-step authorization process for disabling read-only access should be defined and implemented (e.g., approval and justification from multiple users)
e. Break-glass Procedures:  
i. Overriding procedures in emergency situations should be documented and implemented ensuring that only authorized personnel with the highest level of security clearance can disable read-only access
ii. For emergency situations, disabling read-only access on logs should require the approval from at least two authorized individuals
f. Logs Backup: Regular backups, and secure restoration procedures of logs should be conducted and established to ensure that they are protected in case of data loss or corruption
g. Audit Logging and Monitoring: 
i. All access attempts to logs, including read, write, and delete operations should be monitored to provide an audit trail of actions taken on logs, enabling detection of unauthorized modifications
ii. Log data should be monitored for anomalies, inconsistencies, or suspicious activity that may indicate attempts to tamper with logs

The CSP is responsible for ensuring that the users requesting system access are uniquely identifiable and can be directly held responsible for their actions. If the CSP permits the use of shared accounts for privileged access or functions, the system logs should capture the unique ID of the user acting on behalf of the shared account to ensure individual accountability. 

The scope of such shared accounts include the accounts for: cloud administrators responsible for provisioning and deprovisioning cloud infrastructure resources; security administrators  responsible for developing and implementing security policies and procedures; and system operators who are responsible for monitoring resource performance and availability, troubleshooting, and resolving operational issues.

Implementation guidelines to ensure user identification and association with unique IDs include (but are not limited to):

i. The collection purpose, usage, and retention of user IDs should be established, documented and aligned with the CSP's privacy and security regulations to provide users with transparent information about how their data is collected, processed, and shared
ii. Use cases for user identification and the level of sensitivity of the data being associated with user IDs should be defined
iii. Each user account should have a unique ID before any access is granted. If use of shared accounts is permitted, an up-to-date list of shared accounts and all users that can act on behalf of the shared accounts, including their unique IDs and privileges, should be maintained at all times
iv. Any use of a shared account should be traceable to a unique user ID that acted on behalf of the account
v. Automated controls should be implemented to enforce unique identifier requirements
b. Unique ID Generation: A cryptographically secure algorithm to generate unique IDs for users should be employed to prevent the possibility of collisions or reuse of IDs
c. Pseudonymous IDs: Instead of directly associating user IDs with personal data, pseudonymization techniques should be employed and implemented
d. ID Access Control: Access control measures should be implemented to restrict access to user IDs to authorized personnel, systems and processes
e. ID Encryption: All user IDs should be encrypted at rest and in transit to protect them from unauthorized access and data breaches
f. ID Mapping and Linking: A secure and auditable mechanism for mapping user IDs to personal information or other sensitive data should be implemented
g. ID Lifetime Limitations: 
i. Limits on the lifetime of user IDs should be set to prevent the accumulation of excessive personal data over time

a. Authentication Management: 
i. A centralized authentication system that can manage identities, authentication credentials, and access control permissions across all cloud services should be implemented
ii. Users that require privileged access (e.g., administrators and IT staff) should be identified to establish stricter authentication measures
iii. Specific authentication factors and technical measures should be defined and implemented for each access level, including MFA for privileged identities and sensitive data access
b. MFA Usage Scope:
i. Sensitive Data Access:  Strong authentication should be enforced at all user accounts, requiring a combination of something the user: Knows (such as a password); Has (such as a mobile device or token); Is (such as biometrics); MFA for all users should be enabled, including non-privileged users who access sensitive data
ii. Administrative Access: MFA should be enforced for all administrative access (e.g., access to cloud management consoles, virtual machines, remote access gateways, and other critical cloud infrastructure elements). If MFA cannot be implemented in a particular situation, the risk should be formally registered
iii. Remote Access: MFA should be enforced for all remote access, whether through VPNs, web applications, or mobile devices
iv. Third-Party Access: MFA should be enforced for third-party access, such as through APIs or cloud services, to protect against unauthorized access by external entities
c. Second Factor Authentication: Second factor authentication should be leveraged in addition to passwords to add an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor of:
i. Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) to allow users to generate temporary codes via SMS, email, a smartphone app synchronized with an authentication server
ii. Hardware tokens or USB keys that generate unique codes for authentication
d. Passwordless Authentication: Passwordless authentication solutions should be implemented that replace traditional passwords with secure alternatives such as phishing-resistant MFA and FIDO2-compliant security keys or biometrics
e. Authentication Credentials Protection: All authentication credentials should be transmitted through secure channels (e.g., TLS/HTTPS) and never stored in plaintext but rendered unreadable in storage on all system components using strong cryptography
f. Authentication Credentials Change Approval: Requests to change or modify authentication credentials (i.e., performing password resets, provisioning new tokens, generating new keys) should be approved only after verification of the user's identity
g. Continuous User Authentication (CUA): CUA should be leveraged as a method of maintaining user authentication throughout their session, requiring periodic reauthentication to ensure that the user is still authorized and has not been compromised
h. Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO should be implemented for accessing multiple services and applications with a single login credential to simplify the authentication process for users
i. Digital Certificates: Digital certificates should be utilized for authentication and authorization purposes, especially for system identities
j. CRL and OCSP Checks: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) checks should be implemented to verify the validity and revocation status of digital certificates
k. Certificate Lifecycle: The lifecycle of digital certificates should be securely managed including issuance, renewal, and revocation

The CSP is responsible for defining, implementing, and evaluating processes and technical measures for the secure management of authentication credentials (including passwords, PINs, tokens, etc.). All related policies, standards, and procedures should be communicated to all users. Passwords, when used, should be securely managed throughout their usable lifecycle and should follow good password security practices, as mentioned below.

Implementation best practices for secure passwords management include (but are not limited to):
a. Password Strength Requirements: Password requirements should be enforced according to industry standards to enhance passwords strength and make them more resistant to brute-force attacks
b. Password Complexity: Password complexity requirements should be implemented
i. Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
ii. Use numbers and special characters
iii. Avoid easily guessable information, such as common words or patterns
c. Minimum Password Length: Minimum password length should be set to ensure passwords are not too short and easily compromised
d. Password History: A password history policy should be enforced  and record of previously used passwords should be kept to prevent users from reusing their previous passwords
e. Password Expiration: A password expiration policy should be enforced and process implemented to encourage frequent password changes
f. Password Rotation: Users should be encouraged to regularly update their passwords, balanced with the need for strong, unique passwords to avoid predictable patterns
g. Default Passwords Update: All vendor-supplied default configuration of passwords for identities and accounts should be removed and reset according the organizations password management policy
h. Passwords Protection: 
i. Strong password hashing algorithms should be used (e.g., PBKDF2 and bcrypt), and when necessary updated (passwords re-hashing), in accordance with the latest (non-deprecated) industry-standards
ii. A unique ""salt"" for each password should be generated and combined with the password before hashing to prevent attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) for attacks
iii. Secure passwords in storage and in transit (especially during the login process) using strong encryption
i. Password Persistence: 
i. Password persistence should be disabled for client-side applications, preventing passwords from being stored locally on user devices
ii. Saving passwords in web browsers or email applications should be avoided
j. Account Lockout Mechanisms: Account lockout mechanisms should be implemented that temporarily restrict access after a certain number of failed authentication attempts
k. Public Display Prevention: Applications should be configured by default to not display passwords in clear text on any screen (i.e., mask screen display of passwords). A ""show password while typing"" option should be made available to select
l. Password Managers: Users should be provided with access to password managers or integrated password storage capabilities to help them generate and manage strong, unique passwords for different accounts
m. Automated Password Generation: Passwords/passphrases that are automatically chosen should be generated with a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)
n. Password Reset: 
i. The use of Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) mechanisms where users can independently reset their passwords
ii. Upon password reset, users should adhere to the organization's password complexity requirements
iii. Accurate records of all password reset activities should be maintained (e.g., user involved, date and time of the reset, and the reason for the reset)
iv. Use MFA or other additional verification steps (e.g., in-person/telephone confirmation) for password resets on highly-privileged accounts (e.g., tenant root/admin)
o. Password Recovery: Secure mechanisms for password recovery should be implemented (e.g., via email, time-limited recovery links)
p. Passwords Management Monitoring: Monitoring tools should be leveraged to detect and alert on suspicious activities related to password changes or login attempts
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control's implementation responsibility is ""Shared (Independent)"" since the CSP and CSC are both responsible, but also independently managing the processes and procedures to securely manage the user's passwords in their respective organizations. The CSC owns the control in relation to the entities whose access to the cloud environment it provides and maintains, including its internal users, external users (vendors and customers), applications, and services.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.
","1. Determine if processes, procedures and technical measures for the secure management of passwords are defined.
2. Determine if processes, procedures and technical measures for the secure management of passwords are implemented and consistently followed in practice.

Identity & Access Management,Authorization Mechanisms,IAM-16,"Define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures and technical
measures to verify access to data and system functions is authorized.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control's implementation responsibility is ""Shared (Independent)"" since CSP and CSC are both responsible, but also independently manage the processes and procedures to ensure formal approvals are obtained for access granted to users in their respective organizations. The CSP owns the control in relation to the entities whose access to the cloud environment it provides and maintains, including its internal users, external users (vendors and customers), applications, and services.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Verifying access authorization is a fundamental component of effective access control, ensuring that users are granted access based on their legitimate needs and that unauthorized access attempts are promptly identified and prevented.

The CSPs play a critical role in implementing robust technical measures to verify authorization and prevent unauthorized access. Implementation best practices to defining, implementing, and evaluating these measures include (but are not limited to):
a. Authorization Mechanisms:
i. Identities should be provided with only the access necessary to perform their job duties according to the PoLP
ii. Dynamic RBAC, ABAC and Context-aware access control mechanisms should be implemented to assign users specific roles with defined privileges and permissions as part of the access control decision-making process
iii. Explicit permissions (read, write, execute) should be assigned to users or groups on individual resources (e.g., files, databases, applications)
iv. A process to verify that access is authorized before granting permissions should be implemented
b. Authorization Request and Approval:
i. Senior management should be informed of a new user request to access a resource, and with sufficient justification, review, approve, and document such request
ii. Ad-hoc access requests without approvals should not be granted, with exceptions in emergency situations (e.g., resolving a security incident or recovering from a major outage) where they should be approved by senior management
iii. Two levels of approvals should be required for granting privileged entitlements (i.e., approval of the user's manager or supervisor and of the asset owner should be required)
iv. Detection mechanisms should be implemented to identify and report any access that is granted without formal approvals
v. A list of persons who are authorized to approve access types and relevant requests should be documented and maintained
vi. Access rights should be immediately revoked after the business justification for such access ceases to exist
c. Authorization Monitoring and Reviews: Authorization mechanisms should be regularly reviewed and updated. Reviews should be conducted on records of identities activity, including access requests, successful and failed login attempts, and resource usage to ensure that only authorized identities have access
