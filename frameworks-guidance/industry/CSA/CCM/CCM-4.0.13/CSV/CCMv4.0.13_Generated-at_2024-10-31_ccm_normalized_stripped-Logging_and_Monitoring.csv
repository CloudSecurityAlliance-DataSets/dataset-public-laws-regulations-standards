measures to ensure the security and retention of audit logs.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The implementation responsibility for this control is shared between both the CSC and the CSP, however it is expected that the control is implemented independently by each party. Both parties may have different processes, procedures and technical control measures required by contractual, regulatory, or legal factors for the protection and retention of audit logs.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CSPs should implement a strong regime of protection including physical and logical controls to ensure the protection of logs that should be in line with any legal, regulatory or contractual compliance requirements. In events where these are not applicable they should ensure good practice guidelines are followed. 

Protection of logs should ensure the forensic integrity of log files and data, such as restricting unauthorized access, monitoring and auditing log access and changes, and storing in secure environments. 

Log data should be retained for a minimum duration as defined by any legal requirements and/or contractual agreement with the CSC, that can allow for operational and legal investigations or detection of malicious activities.

Additional recommendations that aim to ensure the security and retention of audit logs include (but not limited to): 
a. Centralized Audit Logging: Audit logs should be integrated with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to facilitate centralized storing and management, and for efficient monitoring and correlation of security events

Alerting implementation best practices include (but not limited to):
g. Alerting Rules Configuration: 
i. Monitoring rules should be developed and configured to generate alerts for specific types of security events (e.g., unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, or anomalous traffic patterns)
ii. Alerts should be based on and generated from metrics that indicate risks, events, or incidents that go beyond established or agreed thresholds (e.g., based on CSC requirements)
h. Alerting Rules Review:  Alerting rules should be evaluated and refined periodically based on security trends, threat intelligence updates, and feedback from stakeholders
i. Alerts Categorization: Alerts should be classified based on severity and type, such as high, medium, and low priority, and anomaly detection, intrusion detection, and log analysis events
j. Alerting Prioritization: A hierarchical alerting system should be implemented to prioritize and route alerts to appropriate stakeholders based on severity and impact
k. Alert Data History: Historical alert data should be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and potential gaps in monitoring coverage

"
Logging and Monitoring,Audit Logs Access and Accountability,LOG-04,"Restrict audit logs access to authorized personnel and maintain records
that provide unique access accountability.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
This control's implementation responsibility is shared between the CSP and CSC, however with a dependency between the two parties due to the CSP needing to provide such logging functionality to the CSC and capabilities that allow for the access restriction of logs and accountability of access.

In instances where the CSC does not require their own ability and has shifted obligations for these to the CSP for all deployment models, the CSP would become the owner of the control but would require the CSC guidance on who may be authorized to access logs.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
CSPs should secure audit logs to maintain the integrity and accountability of cloud operations. Both CSPs and CSCs have a responsibility to implement appropriate measures to protect audit logs from unauthorized access and ensure that they are tamper-proof.
Audit logs contain information about activities, actions and events that may be sensitive in nature. Appropriate restrictions should be implemented to protect them from unauthorized access. Audit logs can be used to track access to assist in the identification and detection of suspicious activity. They also contain data that supports investigative needs in relation to analysis and security incidents.

v. The CSP should receive an approved confirmation of any CSC personnel who need access to logs
vi. Where the CSC has requested its own logging of audit logs, the CSP should allow the relevant configurations and forwarding to be supported
c. Unique Access Accountability: Audit log entries should be associated with identities (including usernames, associated roles, purpose of access and resources accessed, IP addresses, and timestamps) to allow for accurate tracking of individual user actions, accountability, and usage for investigations and forensic analysis in accordance to legal/regulatory requirements
d. Session Timeouts: Time-bound access restrictions for audit log access should be implemented, enforcing session timeouts and requiring audit log access reauthentication 
e. Log Access Infrastructure: The infrastructure that hosts and manages access to audit logs should be protected from cyberattacks and unauthorized access. Network and systems security measures should be implemented (refer to IVS domain)
f. Audit Log Transfers Limitation: 
i. The transfer of audit logs to external systems or locations should be minimized, when necessary, in compliance with strict data handling procedures as per SLA
ii. Security tools (e.g., DLP) should be utilized to monitor and prevent the unauthorized export or transmission of sensitive information from audit logs
g. Logging Standardization: Standardized logging and access practices should be established across all cloud environments and services

Logging and Monitoring,Audit Logs Monitoring and Response,LOG-05,"Monitor security audit logs to detect activity outside of typical
or expected patterns. Establish and follow a defined process to review and take
appropriate and timely actions on detected anomalies.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSP is responsible for defining a baseline of expected activity within the cloud infrastructure and access to cloud resources, and for analyzing the audit logs for any other activity that deviates from the baseline. The CSP also establishes a process to investigate the deviations by generating alerts and taking appropriate actions. The implementation responsibility for this control is owned by both CSP and CSC, and in a dependent manner, as the CSP should engage the CSC if the investigation or remediation action requires the involvement of the CSC's personnel.

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
Audit logs contain information about activities, actions, and events that are happening in the cloud environment. These logs can be monitored and analyzed to identify when, what, and who: when the event happened, and of  potentially malicious activities that may have occurred. Remediation actions should be considered within the SLA as necessary to minimize the blast radius and business impact.

A baseline of the normal, expected activity should be defined, and logs should be continuously monitored for any malicious behavior.  

Implementation best practices for logs monitoring include (but not limited to):
a. Log Monitoring:  
i. Audit logs should be monitored for anomalies and suspicious patterns and for all relevant actions (success/failure) such as changes, deletion, copying, or other such modification of settings
ii. Audit logs should be integrated with SIEM systems to correlate log data and provide a holistic view of security anomalies and potential security events
b. Collection and Analysis:  
i. Automated tools should be leveraged to collect and analyze audit logs in real-time or near real-time
ii. The level of detail logged should be limited, especially for sensitive data
iii. Logging of personal data or other confidential data should be avoided and in accordance with laws and regulations
iv. A forensic process for analyzing audit logs should be established in case of security incidents or compliance audits
c. Response Procedures: 
i. Initial response instructions or escalation procedures, including who to contact or what actions to take immediately after anomaly detection should be defined and implemented (e.g., SOP of remediation actions to engage the CSC's personnel)
ii. Response procedures should be implemented (and automated where possible) to streamline the process of investigating detected anomalies, issuing alerts, containing threats, and remediating vulnerabilities
iii. Reporting solutions should provide near real-time visibility of anomalies and potential security events to reduce time to respond and resolve
d. Stakeholders Communication: 
i. Roles and responsibilities should be defined for receiving and escalating security alerts to relevant stakeholders
ii. Multiple communication channels should be employed to ensure timely delivery of alerts
iii. Centralized dashboards should be provided for stakeholders to monitor alert trends, visualize data, and drill down into specific events

Logs Monitoring should be enabled for all relevant types of logs, including, but not limited, to the following cloud systems and applications:
e. Administrative activity logs: These logs pertain to privileged user logins and administrators at all levels of the cloud stack and can be used to identify unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., Identity and access management (IAM) systems, cloud storage systems, authentication servers, and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions)
f. Network Traffic Logs: These are logs for tools that can be used to identify unauthorized access attempts, malicious traffic, and data exfiltration (e.g., Firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), load balancers, web application firewalls (WAFs), virtual private networks (VPNs) Anti-Virus (AV) software, Anti-DDoS, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, etc.)
g. Operating System Logs: Should be used to identify unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation, and malware infections that apply to systems such as operating systems, virtual machines, cloud instances, containers
h. Applications Logs: pertaining to CSC-owned applications or use of third-party applications activity that can be used to identify errors, exceptions, and suspicious activity. These logs apply to systems such as application servers, web servers, databases, containerized applications, application servers, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environments, and serverless computing services
i. Encryption and Key Management Logs: These are Logs from encryption and key management systems/services
j. API Logs: These are logs and metrics from the APIs of the cloud service provider, for the cloud services they provide such as CPU, network, cloud Storage I/O, databases/message queues, cloud management console, platform service logs and metrics, indicating changes in infrastructure configurations

For all logs types, actions (success/failure) such as access, changes, deletions, copying of data, or other modification of configurations and settings should be monitored and relevant logs collected and analyzed.

Logging and Monitoring,Clock Synchronization,LOG-06,"Use a reliable time source across all relevant information processing
systems.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSP should be responsible for synchronizing the system clocks across the cloud infrastructure and systems to ensure that the sequence of events can be properly reconstructed across the systems. 

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The audit log generation mechanisms should be synchronized on all systems by using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) in order to capture the date and time stamp of each event that is recorded in the log files. if system logs are not properly synced then there will be differences in the clock settings across systems and infrastructure, the date and time stamps of the activities will not match, as they would have happened in the real time, so those logs would not be beneficial in a security incident investigation or would not be permissible as evidence.

The following guidelines should be applied:
a. Centralized Time Service: 
i. A centralized time service should be created and maintained to provide clock synchronization to all assets and systems on their bootup, start, or restart
ii. Adhere to industry standards for time synchronization, such as RFC 5905 for Network Time Protocol (NTP) to ensure compatibility and interoperability with various systems and to serve as centralized and reliable time source
b. Regular Clock Synchronization: 
i. All servers within the cloud environment should be regularly synchronized with centralized NTP servers to maintain consistency across the infrastructure
ii. A clock synchronization service should be provided that the CSC can consume to synchronize its hosted assets
c. Systems Configuration: A process should be created to ensure all assets and systems are configured to obtain the time for clock synchronization from the centralized service
d. Clock Settings Integrity: Authentication mechanisms should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with time information and to protect the integrity of the time synchronization process
e. Sync Monitoring and Alerting: 
i. Monitoring systems should be set up to detect any deviations or discrepancies in time synchronization
ii. Alerting mechanisms should be in place to notify relevant stakeholders (e.g., administrators, CSCs) of any time synchronization issues
","Control Ownership Rationale.
For the IaaS and PaaS service models the CSP has the main technical responsibility of synchronizing clocks on all hardware, while the CSC should be responsible in enforcing some technical or administrative controls related to time synchronization. For SaaS, the CSP is exclusively responsible for implementing this control.

Implementation Guidelines.
IaaS Customer:
The CSC should configure guest operating systems to synchronize a trusted time source. It is recommended to use a time source provided by the CSP.
The CSC should enforce administrative controls requiring its technical personnel to configure time accurately in its guest OS and applications and guarantee its integrity. Unauthorized changes to time synchronization should be considered as a risk and should trigger a log event.

PaaS Customer:
The CSC should enforce administrative controls requiring its technical personnel to guarantee the integrity of time configuration. Unauthorized changes to time synchronization should be considered as a risk and should trigger a log event.

SaaS Customer:
This control's implementation applies to the CSP only.

The following guidelines should be applied:
a. Verification of CSP's Time Controls: Verify that the CSP has implemented centralized and reliable time sources, such as NTP servers, to maintain accurate time across the infrastructure
b. Configuration Settings: CSC systems and applications should be configured to synchronize their time with the centralized NTP servers provided by the CSP
c. Regular Time Checks: Regular time checks and synchronization routines should be implemented within CSC applications to ensure accurate and consistent timekeeping
d. Dependency Considerations: Time synchronization dependencies should be considered when designing and deploying applications, to ensure that time-sensitive operations and events are correctly coordinated
e. Documentation and Compliance: The time synchronization procedures implemented within CSC systems should be documented and compliance with any industry or regulatory standards related to timekeeping met
f. Audit Trails: Audit trails that record time-related events should be maintained to facilitate traceability and accountability in case of discrepancies or security incidents
g. Communication with CSP: Open communication with the CSP should be maintained regarding time synchronization practices in support of alignment and addressing any concerns or specific requirements
","1. Examine policy that establishes the time scale and epoch, or traceability, of time across systems.
2. Evaluate the process that ensures synchronization of time on relevant systems.

over the operations of cryptographic, encryption and key management policies,
processes, procedures, and controls.
","Control Ownership Rationale.
The CSP and CSC are responsible for independently implementing an internal monitoring and reporting process over cryptographic operations. Although the CSP is responsible for implementing the encryption protocol, it is the responsibility of the CSC to monitor and test proper use of cryptographic operations on their portion of their shared cloud infrastructure (refer to the CEK domain for more details on policies, processes, and controls for cryptography).

Implementation Guidelines.
Applicable to all service models:
The use of cryptography to protect sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure or tampering (while in transit or at rest) needs to be governed through a well defined set of policies, standards, and procedures (refer to CEK-01 for details). The use of encryption keys should be monitored and any deviations should be reported and handled as per the policies.

Cryptographic operations should be logged, monitored, and reported to ensure any unauthorized key usage event is escalated via security incident management process and remediated. 

The log data should be protected from unauthorized tampering by implementing various solutions that protect the file integrity.

Implementation best practices for CSPs to establish and maintain effective monitoring and internal reporting capabilities for encryption and key management include (but not limited to):

c. Baselines and Thresholds: Baselines and thresholds for normal encryption and key management operations should be established (e.g., key usage, access patterns, and error rates)
d. Alerting and Reporting Mechanisms: 
i. Alerting and reporting mechanisms should be implemented to notify security teams of activities that deviate from established baselines or exceed defined thresholds
ii. Regular reports should be generated summarizing encryption and key management activities (including trends, anomalies, and potential risks)
iii. Reports should be shared with stakeholders, including security teams, compliance officers, and CSC to foster transparency and accountability
e. Monitoring Process Review: 
i. Monitoring processes of cryptographic operations should be regularly reviewed to ensure they remain effective in detecting and addressing security threats
