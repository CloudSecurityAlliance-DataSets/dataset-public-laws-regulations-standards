It is shared and should be implemented by each party, CSC and the CSP, however independently from one another. Both entities may have different screening policies and processes that they should fill respective of their countries, contractual and regulatory requirements.\n\nImplementation Guidelines.\nApplicable to all service models:\nThe CSP is responsible for implementing internal measures to ensure that permanent and temporary staff, outsourced consultants and any other third-party service providers have been appropriately screened and vetted in relation to the level, amount and frequency of access to systems or sites required by their role. The screening processes should be established and precede any activity in granting access to systems. \n\nScreening processes should be conducted by authorized and specialized departments to compartmentalize any and all personal data/sensitive information gathered during the screening processes. The CSP should make reasonable arrangements to assure the CSC of staff trust level. Where appropriate, it should conduct client-specific screening to their requirements for staff with access to the CSC's systems such as government or law enforcement agencies. In situations where screening is delayed, for example, the inability to contact references or verification checks taking a long time, should implement mitigating controls for the interim, such as:\na. Delaying start date or onboarding\nb. Not issuing access or credentials\nc. Allowing access but limiting or restricting permissions\n\nWhere circumstances cause complications, or screening has detected previous issues such as criminal records or information that causes concern, processes should be in place to escalate matters or to terminate offers of employment.\n\nPolicies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\na. Scope and Objectives: the scope and objectives of background verification, including the types of positions, roles, and access levels of employees, contractors, and third parties that require background checks. The verification process should be tailored to the level of access to sensitive data and the nature of responsibilities\nb.

Consider specific regulations related to the handling of personal information in different jurisdictions\nc. Ethics and Contractual Constraints: ethical considerations and contractual obligations with customers and partners. It should ensure that background checks are conducted in a fair and unbiased manner, minimizing any potential for discrimination or invasion of privacy\nd. Risk Assessment for Background Verification: The extent of background verification should be proportionate to the data classification to be accessed, the business requirements, and the acceptable risk level. More sensitive roles or access to highly confidential data may warrant more rigorous background checks.\ne. Verification Checks: Outline the specific verification checks to be conducted.\ni. Identity Verification: Confirming the individual's identity through valid government-issued documents.\nii. Education Verification: Verifying educational credentials and qualifications as claimed (e.g., claimed degrees and certifications)\niii. Employment History Verification: Verifying previous employment history and job responsibilities (e.g., positions held, duration, and reasons for leaving.\niv. Reference Checks: Conduct professional reference checks to assess the candidate's skills, work habits, and reliability.\nv. Criminal Background Checks: Conduct criminal background checks in accordance with local laws and regulations and define the criteria for disqualification based on the nature of offenses\nf. Third-Party Background Check Services: If using third-party background check providers, the policy should establish strict guidelines for selecting reputable and secure service providers\ni.

Require strong passwords, PIN, or biometric authentication to unlock screens (refer to IAM-02)\niii. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users to further enhance screen lock security\nc. Automatic Logout:\ni. Implement an automatic session logout feature after a specified period of inactivity to ensure that users are not inadvertently leaving their sessions open\nii. automatically lock remote desktop sessions when not in use, and require secure authentication for re-entry\nd. Privacy Screens: Encourage or require the use of privacy screens on devices to limit the visibility of screens to individuals in close proximity\ne.

Remote working increases the risk and threat profile of a cloud organization as these boundaries of protection may become weakened or assets may be compromised through various means. The CSP has a responsibility to protect its core systems and its CSC's data. The policy should be defined and deployed to provide its personnel the appropriate security requirements, controls and procedures to follow while they work remotely.\n\nPersonnel should be trained and informed of risks when working remotely, as the shift to a decentralized work environment introduces various cybersecurity threats that individuals must be vigilant against. \n\nOne prevalent risk is the increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. Additionally, the use of unsecured Wi-Fi networks in home environments poses a potential threat, as it opens avenues for unauthorized access and data interception. Remote workers should also be cautious about the security of their devices, as the loss or theft of laptops or mobile devices can lead to unauthorized access to corporate data. Furthermore, the reliance on personal devices and unsecured applications for work tasks may expose organizations to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information. \n\nPolicies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:\na.

Objective of policy is to ensure that remote employees are aware of and comply with the organization's cloud security policies and procedures\nb. Secure Network Connections: Require the use of a VPN for secure and encrypted communication, with strong encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms, between remote devices and the corporate network\nc. Remote Working MFA Access: Require the use of MFA for accessing corporate systems and cloud services. The use of MFA on all devices and applications to add an extra layer of security should be encouraged\nd. Endpoints Protection: Require the deployment of endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware and other security threats\ni. Implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Endpoint Management solutions for remote device configuration, monitoring, and security enforcement (e.g., anti-malware, device encryption, secure email, etc.) (refer to UEM domain)\nii. Educate remote workers about the risks of using public Wi-Fi and recommend the use of a VPN when connecting to public networks\niii. Provide guidelines for securing home Wi-Fi networks, including the use of strong encryption (WPA3) and changing default credentials\ne. Secure Remote Desktop Solutions: Where applicable, require the use secure remote desktop solutions with strong encryption and authentication\nf. Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks\ng. Regular Software Updates: Enable automatic updates whenever possible and educate users on the importance of keeping software up to date\nh. Remote Data Backups: Require regular backups of critical data stored on remote devices and test data restoration procedures periodically to ensure data can be recovered in case of loss or a security incident\ni. Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks.\nj. Secure Printing: Educate remote workers with secure printing practices, such as immediately retrieving printed documents with sensitive data\nk.
