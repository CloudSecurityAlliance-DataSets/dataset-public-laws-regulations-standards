For example, exercises may include performing duties in a simulated environment (i.e., functional) or be discussion based (i.e., tabletop).\n\nTo exercise and test business continuity and operational resilience plans the CSP should establish:\na. Exercise and Testing Framework:\ni. The goals of the exercise and testing program should be defined to align with the overall business continuity and operational resilience strategies and plans\nii. The essential processes that must be maintained during disruptions should be determined, considering dependencies and potential impact on customer service\niii. A regular testing cadence should be established on an annual basis or upon significant changes, to support ongoing preparedness\niv. Realistic and challenging scenarios should be designed that encompass a wide range of potential disruptions, such as cloud outages, data loss, and cyberattacks\nv. Documentation should be developed outlining the exercise and testing procedures, including roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols\nb. Communication and Collaboration:\ni. Well-defined communication channels should be established to facilitate timely and accurate information sharing during exercises and tests\nii. Roles and responsibilities should be defined for all stakeholders involved in exercise and testing activities, ensuring accountability and coordination\niii. Open and transparent communication should be encouraged throughout the exercise and testing process to identify and address issues promptly\niv. Collaborative tools and platforms should be used to facilitate real-time communication, information sharing, and decision-making during exercises and tests\nc. Simulation and Emulation Technologies:\ni. Simulation and emulation technologies should be leveraged to create realistic and immersive scenarios that replicate real-world disruptions\nii. Simulation and emulation tools should be used to test the resilience of cloud infrastructure, applications, and data under various disruptive scenarios\niii. Backup and recovery procedures should be tested to ensure the ability to restore critical data and systems following a disruption\niv. The performance of systems and processes during simulations and emulations should be analyzed to identify areas for improvement and strengthen resilience\nv. A variety of exercises can be employed to assess the effectiveness of the business continuity and operational resilience plans (e.g., tabletops, walk-through, simulation, parallel, and full-scale exercises)\nd. Continuous Improvement:\ni. The outcomes of each exercise and test should be documented including identified issues, lessons learned, and corrective actions taken\nii. Trends and patterns identified across multiple exercises and tests to gain insights into recurring vulnerabilities and areas for improvement should be analyzed\niii. Lessons learned from exercises and tests should be shared with relevant stakeholders to enhance organizational-wide resilience\ne. Review and Updates:  Business continuity and operational resilience plans should be regularly reviewed and updated based on the findings of exercises and tests as well as the organization's business processes, assets, and risks evolution\n\nThe CSP should ensure recovery testing is conducted at least annually, or more frequently, depending on the operating environment and criticality of the applications and business functions.\n",

Backup Strategy: A backup strategy should be established that includes regular backup schedules, incremental backups, and full backups, including the physical location of backup files, which should comply with the privacy and data protection laws and regulations applicable to the data collected\ni. Multiple backup methods, including cloud-based backup services, on-premises storage, and offline backups should be utilized\nii. The 3-2-1 backup rule can be used: three copies of data on two different media, with one copy stored offsite\nb. Separate Location Backup: Backups should be stored in a separate location physically or logically isolated from the primary cloud data storage\nc. Backup Encryption: Backup data should be encrypted with strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices to prevent unauthorized access\nd. Backup Integrity Verification: The integrity of backups should be regularly verified with the use of data integrity verification mechanisms like cryptographic hashes, checksums or message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure they are not corrupted or tampered with\ne. Backup Repository Access Control:  Access control for backup repositories should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access and access permissions should be regularly reviewed and updated\nf.

Data Restoration and Resiliency: \ni. RPOs and RTOs should be defined and used as metrics to guide backup frequency and recovery strategies\nii. A comprehensive data restoration plan should be established that outlines the steps to restore data from backups in case of data loss or corruption. Regularly test the plan to ensure its effectiveness\niii. Backup restorations should be carried out only after they have been approved by authorized personnel (according to contractual agreements with CSCs or the internal policies of the CSP)\niv. Backup and data restoration processes should be automated to minimize manual intervention, downtime and expedite recovery\nv. Use automation tools to schedule backups, monitor backup health, trigger restorations and manage the restoration workflow\nvi. Replicate data to multiple data centers or geographic regions to ensure data availability in case of regional outages or disasters. Use replication technologies like synchronous or asynchronous replication\nvii. Backup restores should be regularly tested to ensure the ability to recover from data loss or corruption\ni. Backup Monitoring and Logging: Continuous monitoring and logging of data backup and restoration processes should be implemented to detect and address any potential issues promptly. Use monitoring tools to track backup status, data integrity, restoration performance, and set up alerts for any anomalies or failures in the backup system\nj. Third-Party Assessments: Engage in third-party security assessments and to validate the effectiveness of backup and security measures\nk. Communication with the CSC: The CSP, when appropriate, should be able to disclose the backup and restoration test results to the CSC as part of the assurance of business continuity and resilience\nl.

Data replication strategies should be implemented to ensure data consistency and availability across redundant data centers \ne. Automated Failover Mechanisms: Automated failover mechanisms should be configured to seamlessly switch traffic to the redundant equipment in the event of a primary equipment failure to ensure that operations continue uninterrupted without manual intervention\nf. Testing and Maintenance: Regular testing of redundant equipment should be conducted to ensure its readiness and functionality.
