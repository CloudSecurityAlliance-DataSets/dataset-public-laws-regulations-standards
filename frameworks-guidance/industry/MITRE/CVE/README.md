# CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

MITRE's CVE database provides a standardized method for identifying and cataloging publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

## Overview

CVE is a dictionary of common names (i.e., CVE identifiers) for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. CVE's common identifiers make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability databases and security tools.

## Key Information

- **Maintainer**: MITRE Corporation
- **Purpose**: Standardized vulnerability identification system
- **Format**: CVE-YYYY-NNNN (e.g., CVE-2023-12345)
- **Scope**: Publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities

- **Resources and Documentation**: https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Resources
- **Project Documentation**: https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-documents
- **Legacy MITRE Site**: https://cve.mitre.org/ (historical)

## Data Sources

- **Primary Data**: https://www.cve.org/Downloads
- **NVD Integration**: https://nvd.nist.gov/
- **JSON Feeds**: https://cveawg.mitre.org/api/
- **API Access**: CVE Services API (https://cveawg.mitre.org/api/)

## Security Relevance

- **Cloud Security**: Critical for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure components
- **AI Security**: Essential for tracking vulnerabilities in AI/ML frameworks and tools
- **Supply Chain**: Helps identify vulnerabilities in third-party components

## Processing Notes

CVE data is available in multiple formats:
- JSON feeds (recommended)
- XML feeds (legacy)
- Web scraping (not recommended)

Regular updates are published as new vulnerabilities are disclosed.
