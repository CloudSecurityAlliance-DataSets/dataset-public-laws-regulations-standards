# STIX/TAXII (Structured Threat Information eXpression / Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information)

MITRE's STIX and TAXII provide standardized languages and transport mechanisms for cyber threat intelligence sharing.

## Overview

STIX is a language for describing cyber threat information, while TAXII defines how STIX data is exchanged between organizations. Together they enable automated sharing of actionable cyber threat information.

## Key Information

- **Maintainer**: MITRE Corporation (with OASIS standardization)
- **Purpose**: Standardized threat intelligence sharing
- **Current Versions**: STIX 2.1, TAXII 2.1
- **Format**: JSON-based (STIX 2.x), XML-based (STIX 1.x legacy)

## Components

### STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression)
- **Purpose**: Language for describing threat intelligence
- **Objects**: Indicators, malware, attack patterns, threat actors, etc.
- **Relationships**: Links between different threat intelligence objects

### TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information)
- **Purpose**: Transport protocol for STIX data
- **Services**: Discovery, collection management, polling, inbox
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and encryption

## Security Relevance

- **Cloud Security**: Enables sharing of cloud-specific threat intelligence
- **AI Security**: Supports sharing of AI/ML-related threat information
- **Incident Response**: Facilitates rapid sharing of IOCs and TTPs
- **Threat Hunting**: Provides structured format for threat hunting data

## Integration with Other Frameworks

- **ATT&CK**: ATT&CK techniques are expressed as STIX objects
- **CVE**: Vulnerabilities can be represented as STIX objects
- **CAPEC**: Attack patterns integrate with STIX threat data

## Processing Notes

STIX/TAXII implementations require:
- JSON schema validation for STIX 2.x
- RESTful API support for TAXII 2.x
- Proper handling of relationships between objects
- Security considerations for data sharing
