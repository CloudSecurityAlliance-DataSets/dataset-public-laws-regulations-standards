# OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language)

OVAL is a community standard for representing system configuration information, assessing machine state, and reporting assessment results.

## Overview

OVAL provides a language for encoding system details and an assortment of content repositories that store collections of publicly available OVAL Definitions for vulnerabilities, configuration issues, patches, and other system states.

## Key Information

- **Original Maintainer**: MITRE Corporation
- **Current Maintainer**: Center for Internet Security (CIS)
- **Purpose**: Standardized vulnerability and configuration assessment
- **Current Version**: OVAL 5.11.3
- **Format**: XML-based definitions and results

## Components

### OVAL Language
- **Definitions**: Tests for specific vulnerabilities or configurations
- **Tests**: Platform-specific checks (Windows, Linux, etc.)
- **Objects**: System components to examine
- **States**: Expected conditions or values

### OVAL Repository
- **Vulnerability Definitions**: Tests for known vulnerabilities
- **Patch Definitions**: Tests for missing security updates
- **Compliance Definitions**: Configuration compliance checks
- **Inventory Definitions**: System component identification

## Security Relevance

- **Cloud Security**: Assessment of cloud instance configurations and vulnerabilities
- **AI Security**: Configuration checks for AI/ML infrastructure components  
- **Compliance**: Automated compliance checking against security baselines
- **Vulnerability Management**: Structured vulnerability detection and reporting

## Platform Support

OVAL definitions exist for:
- **Windows**: Registry, file system, services, patches
- **Linux/Unix**: Package managers, file systems, configurations
- **Network Devices**: Router and switch configurations
- **Applications**: Database, web server, middleware configurations

## Transition from MITRE

OVAL was transferred from MITRE to the Center for Internet Security (CIS) in 2016:
- **Historical**: MITRE developed and maintained OVAL through version 5.10
- **Current**: CIS maintains OVAL 5.11+ and the community repository
- **Legacy Content**: Historical OVAL definitions from MITRE era remain available

## Processing Notes

OVAL implementations require:
- XML schema validation for definitions and results
- Platform-specific interpreters for different operating systems
- Regular updates to definition repositories
- Integration with vulnerability scanners and compliance tools
