# CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

MITRE's CWE provides a unified, measurable set of software and hardware weakness types that serve as a common language for describing security weaknesses.

## Overview

CWE is a community-developed list of common software and hardware security weaknesses. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.

## Key Information

- **Maintainer**: MITRE Corporation
- **Purpose**: Standardized software and hardware weakness classification
- **Format**: CWE-ID (e.g., CWE-79, CWE-89)
- **Scope**: Software weaknesses, hardware weaknesses, research concepts

## Key CWE Views

- **CWE-1000**: Research Concepts View
- **CWE-699**: Software Development View  
- **CWE-1194**: Hardware Design View
- **CWE-1350**: Weaknesses in the 2023 CWE Top 25

## Security Relevance

- **Cloud Security**: Identifies common weaknesses in cloud applications and infrastructure
- **AI Security**: Catalogs weaknesses specific to AI/ML systems and algorithms
- **Secure Development**: Foundation for secure coding practices and training
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Links vulnerabilities (CVEs) to underlying weaknesses

## Relationship to Other MITRE Frameworks

- **CVE**: CVEs often reference the underlying CWE weakness types
- **CAPEC**: Attack patterns in CAPEC exploit weaknesses catalogued in CWE
- **OWASP Top 10**: Many OWASP categories map to specific CWE entries

## Processing Notes
