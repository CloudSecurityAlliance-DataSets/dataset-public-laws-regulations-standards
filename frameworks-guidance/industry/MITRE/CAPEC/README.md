# CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification)

MITRE's CAPEC provides a publicly available catalog of common attack patterns that helps users understand how adversaries exploit weaknesses in applications and other cyber-enabled capabilities.

## Overview

CAPEC is a comprehensive dictionary and classification taxonomy of known attacks that can be used by analysts, developers, testers, and educators to advance community understanding and enhance defenses.

## Key Information

- **Maintainer**: MITRE Corporation
- **Purpose**: Standardized attack pattern identification and classification
- **Format**: CAPEC-ID (e.g., CAPEC-1, CAPEC-100)
- **Scope**: Attack patterns across software, hardware, and social engineering domains

- **About CAPEC**: https://capec.mitre.org/about/index.html
- **Attack Pattern List**: https://capec.mitre.org/data/index.html
- **User Guide**: https://capec.mitre.org/about/documents.html

## Data Sources

- **CAPEC Database**: https://capec.mitre.org/data/downloads.html
- **XML Format**: https://capec.mitre.org/data/xml/capec_latest.xml
- **JSON Format**: Available through conversion tools
- **Web Interface**: https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/

## Security Relevance

- **Cloud Security**: Identifies attack patterns specific to cloud environments and services
- **AI Security**: Catalogs attacks targeting AI/ML systems and algorithms
- **Threat Modeling**: Essential for understanding how attacks are executed
- **Defense Planning**: Helps design countermeasures against known attack patterns

## Relationship to Other MITRE Frameworks

- **CWE**: CAPEC attack patterns exploit CWE weaknesses
- **ATT&CK**: CAPEC provides more detailed attack patterns that map to ATT&CK techniques
- **D3FEND**: D3FEND countermeasures defend against CAPEC attack patterns
