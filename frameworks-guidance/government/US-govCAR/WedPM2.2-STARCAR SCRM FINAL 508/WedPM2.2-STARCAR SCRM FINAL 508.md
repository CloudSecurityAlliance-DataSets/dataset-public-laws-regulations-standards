# Dodcar/.Govcar Vision & Purpose

## Vision

DOD has the insight and knowledge necessary to make prioritized capability decisions to enable dependable mission execution on the Unclassified and Secret Fabrics Inform DHS's approach to assisting Departments and Agencies with insight and knowledge to make prioritized cybersecurity investment decisions across the .gov environment

## Purpose

Evolve the cybersecurity architecture as necessary and create an implementation road map for the DODIN infrastructure based on an endto-end holistic review of the security architecture and current implementations and plans.

Create a solid rationale using the Adversary Lifecycle as a framework, informed by current classified and unclassified threat data

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

Create a threat-based security architecture framework to discuss and assess cybersecurity architectural choices:
●
For a shared Federal IT
Infrastructure To affect DHS's approach for its capabilities
●
●
To empower Departments and Agencies to make threat-based risk decisions 1

# Dodcar / .Govcar Work Activities

## Endpoint Security Modernization

.

Performed threat-based analysis of DoD
Endpoint Security Suite alternatives
.

Developed test plans, pilots and experiments to determine coverage
(effectiveness) of alternatives and compared DoDCAR's initial endpoint recommendation using observed threat activity
●
Developing "Greenfield" endpoint architecture and analyzing threat coverage through DoDCAR process

## Perimeter Security Modernization

•
Threat-based analysis of DoD Perimeter Security Suite alternatives leveraging success of the Endpoint Security Modernization effort SPIN 1 - Score DHS provided cybersecurity elements in the context of a typical large D/A
environment.

SPIN 2 - Score exemplar D/A protections at boundary and endpoint SPIN 3 - Score exemplar D/A
protections for virtual data center
(laaS and SaaS)
SPIN 4 - Score exemplar D/A
protections for data center SPIN 5 - Mobile IMPACT: Reduction of Cyber Vulnerabilities, Enhanced Security and
