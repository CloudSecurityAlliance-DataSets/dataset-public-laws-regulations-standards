,"An acceptable boundary diagram is a clearly marked boundary (e.g., a labeled box or line around the components included). The diagram must be legible and readable.
The diagram should:
• Include a clearly defined authorization boundary,
• Include system interconnections used to operate and support the intended mission/business functions,
• Depict every tool, service, or component that is mentioned in the SSP narrative, and controls,
• Identify those depicted tools, services, or components as either external or internal to the boundary, 
• Identify all interconnected systems, and whether they are FedRAMP Authorized (or not),
• Depict how CSP and customer/agency access the service (e.g., authentication used to access service),
• Depict all major software/virtual components (or groups of) within the boundary,
• Be validated against the inventory,
• Show alternate processing site, and
• Show pulling of updates from external services (such as OS and antivirus updates).

Supporting text should describe all internal components."

,"The data flow diagrams should be consistent with the authorization boundary and should: 
• Clearly identify anywhere federal data is to be processed, stored, or transmitted,
• Clearly delineate how data comes into and out of the system boundary, 
• Clearly identify data flows for privileged, non-privileged and customers' access with MFA details, and
• Depict how all ports, protocols, and services of all inbound and outbound traffic are represented and managed.
• For each data flow, clearly depict protective mechanisms (encryption type and FIPS 140-2 validation or use of other alternative implementations such as physical protection via protective distribution systems [PDS]), where applicable.

Note: If any data flows are not protected by encryption, the CSP should be prepared to provide the FedRAMP PMO clarifying details so that a risk decision can be made related to FedRAMP authorization: 
• Identify the data flow(s) and stores that is/are not encrypted,
• Describe the impacted data (government data, government metadata, CSP data, etc.),
• Sensitivity of the impacted data (Low vs Moderate),
• Mitigations in place,
• Remediation plan, where appropriate,
• Projected date of remediation, where appropriate."

,"Consistently address the external services as follows:
1. Table 8-3. Leveraged Authorizations - should contain all FedRAMP Authorized CSOs
2. Tables 11-1. System Interconnections and 13-3. CA-3 Authorized Connections, and SAR Section 6. Risks Known For Interconnected Systems - should catalog all external services
3. SA-9 External Information System Services - should address all external services where federal information is processed or stored
4. Supporting narrative -  
  a) Provide a brief description of how each is used in support of the CSO
  b) Describe the data shared with each external service - particularly those lacking FedRAMP authorization
5. ABD - 
  a) Show how each external service interacts with users and the CSO boundary
  b) Depict the FedRAMP authorization status for each external service
6. DFD - show the encryption status and authentication mechanism for all connections from the ABD
7. All of the above should address external services at the CSP/CSO level
8. When the external service is FedRAMP Authorized, use the name from the FedRAMP Marketplace
9. When leveraging CSOs where FedRAMP authorization is conducted at the internal service level:
  a) This is typical for FedRAMP Authorized IaaS/PaaS CSOs
  b) Depict on the ABD all the internal leveraged services in use
  c) Indicate the FedRAMP authorization status for each
10. Have all external services been appropriately documented in the SAR? 
  a) It is expected that the 3PAO accurately reflect the risks due to external service interconnections to the system. At minimum, there should be a correlation to the SSP. "
