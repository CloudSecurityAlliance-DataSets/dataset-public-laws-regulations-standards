## 1. Introduction

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®) created a conformity assessment process to recoqnize third party assessment orqanizations (3PAOs) through accreditation by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). This process ensures 3PAOs meet the necessary quality, independence, and FedRAMP knowledge requirements to perform independent security assessments required by FedRAMP. To maintain recognition, 3PAOs must continue to demonstrate independence, quality, and FedRAMP knowledge as they perform security assessments on cloud systems.

### 2. Background

FedRAMP provides a cost-effective, risk-based approach, for the adoption and use of cloud services, by making standardized security requirements for the authorization and onqoing cybersecurity of cloud products and services available to executive departments and agencies. In partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), FedRAMP developed a conformity assessment program with the qoal of producing consistent, independent third-party assessments of security controls implemented by cloud service providers (CSPs). FedRAMP developed criteria for 3PAOs to ensure they provide independent assessments of a CSP's implementation of the FedRAMP security requirements.

The roles and responsibilities of a FedRAMP 3PAO are critical. 3PAOs independently assess the effectiveness of security controls associated with cloud service offerings (CSOs). 3PAO assessments serve as the basis from which the federal qovernment makes informed, risk-based authorization for the qovernment's use of cloud products and services. To learn more about the roles and responsibilities of 3PAOs, refer to Appendix A: Detailed 3PAO Roles and Responsibilities.

Orqanizations interested in becoming FedRAMP recognized 3PAOs must be accredited by A2LA, which follows International Standardization Orqanization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 17020 (as revised) Requirements for the Operation of Various Types of Bodies Performing Inspection.

### 3. Fedramp Recognition

In order to become a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO, A2LA must perform an initial assessment of an independent assessment organization (IAO) and provide an initial assessment recommendation to FedRAMP for approval. For a 3PAO to maintain its FedRAMP recognition, A2LA must perform a favorable annual review and a full on-site reassessment every two years.

A2LA assessments ensure 3PAOs meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17020 (as revised) and FedRAMP-specific knowledge requirements. A2LA provides an assessment report to FedRAMP that documents the 3PAO:

- ls competent to perform inspections of CSP documents and technical system elements ●
- Has a documented, fully operational, and adequately maintained quality management system ● (QMS) that meets the standards of ISO/IEC 17020 (as revised) and FedRAMP-specific knowledge requirements
- . ls operating in accordance with its QMS
- Demonstrates technical competence of individual assessors through education, training, technical . knowledge, skills, and experience as required by A2LA (information regarding A2LA's FedRAMP requirements can be found at https://www.a2la.orq/accreditation/fedramp and https://portal.a2la.org/documents/)

### 3PAO Obligations Standards 4.

FedRAMP requires all 3PAOs to adhere strictly and continuously to FedRAMP requirements and follow their ISO/IEC 17020 (as revised) QMS, as described in their application, and evaluated by A2LA. Among these requirements, a few key items are:

- . 3PAOs must be independent from any CSP they assess
- 3PAOs are only allowed to be a Type A or Type C Inspection Body ●
- 3PAOs must perform assessments that meet a high standard of independence, quality, accuracy, ● integrity, and timeliness
- 3PAOs must demonstrate knowledge of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and FedRAMP-specific requirements when conducting their assessments
- . 3PAOs must develop and maintain a training program for their personnel including, at a minimum, content incorporating FISMA, FedRAMP, cloud computing, and cybersecurity
- . 3PAOs must meet the personnel requirements for years of experience, training, certification qualifications, and technical proficiency activities
- 3PAOs must comply with requirements set forth in the FedRAMP Authorization Act, includinq ● section 3612. Declaration of foreign interests

3PAOs must continuously meet and demonstrate they are performing in accordance with ISO/IEC 17020 (as revised) and FedRAMP requirements to maintain their FedRAMP recognition.

#### 3PAO Performance Standards 5.

During FedRAMP assessments, 3PAOs produce a Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) or a complete security authorization package. A complete security authorization package includes:

- Security Assessment Plan (SAP) .
	- Inventories o
	- O Rules of Engagement
- Security Assessment Report (SAR) .
	- o Security Assessment Test Case Workbook
	- O Risk Exposure Table
	- Penetration Test Report O
	- Vulnerability Scan Data Files O
	- Test Artifacts o

These 3PAO documents, and personnel that develop them, must meet the following standards, reflective of their FedRAMP recognition:

| Performance Standard                 | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Assessment Integrity                 | Submit independent assessments of a CSP's security posture<br>uninfluenced by CSP demands                                                                                                                                  |
| Personnel Qualifications             | Meet all personnel qualification requirements, as published by<br>A2LA, in the R311 - Specific Requirements: Federal Risk and<br>Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) policy                                         |

Failure of a 3PAO to perform according to these standards, as further detailed in Appendix B: Detailed 3PAO Performance Standards, affects the qovernment's ability to authorize cloud systems based on a 3PAO's

independent assessment. Any 3PAO assessment deliverables containing work performed, prepared, or submitted by 3PAO personnel who do not meet the requirements for their role, based on the available information in the Baltimore Cyber Range (BCR) 3PAO Personnel Database, will be determined to be invalid, will be rejected, and will need to be redone by personnel who meet the required qualifications. FedRAMP will pursue corrective actions and possible removal of FedRAMP recognition if 3PAO deliverables and personnel do not meet these performance standards.

## 6. Performance Management

The qovernment evaluates all 3PAO products and expects superior quality and performance. Quality is expected across the government, regardless of whether a 3PAO is working directly with the loint Authorization Board (JAB), FedRAMP PMO, or an agency. In the event that a 3PAO's performance does not meet FedRAMP standards, FedRAMP has the authority and responsibility to pursue corrective actions related to the 3PAO's FedRAMP recognition status. Corrective actions and potential change of a 3PAO's FedRAMP recognition status include the following:

- 1. Consultation
- 2. In-Remediation
- 3. Revoked

FedRAMP reserves the right to place a 3PAO in any of these statuses.

Multiple revocations may require extended time spent in this status while also demonstrating acceptable performance in the A2LA Cybersecurity Inspection Body Program, prior to seeking recognition again as a FedRAMP 3PAO. Certain severe infractions identified by A2LA or FedRAMP, following revocation, may result in the inability for an IAO to pursue FedRAMP recognition aqain.
