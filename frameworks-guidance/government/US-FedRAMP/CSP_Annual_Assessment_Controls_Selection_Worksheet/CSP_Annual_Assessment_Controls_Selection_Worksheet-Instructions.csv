,Overview,,,,,,
,"The FedRAMP Annual Assessment Controls Selection Worksheet provides a matrix to assist CSPs, 3PAOs, and federal agencies in assessing and tracking controls for their annual assessment. In May 2023, FedRAMP security control baselines were updated from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 (Rev. 4) to align with NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 (Rev. 5). The list of core controls, those controls required to be assessed annually, are provided in several tabs of this worksheet.

,,"These columns are for indicating the rationale for assessing this control (e.g., if the control requirement is related to a Deviation Request for a False Positive, Risk Adjustment, and/or Operational Requirement, Vendor Dependencies, or a system change implemented by a CSP since the last annual assessment). A 3PAO is required to validate these items for continued applicability to the system.

Where a control is selected for an assessment due to a system change, including significant/major change, the rationale should be concise and descriptive of the change.

Information on FedRAMP Rev. 4 and Rev. 5 core controls is included below.",,,,,
