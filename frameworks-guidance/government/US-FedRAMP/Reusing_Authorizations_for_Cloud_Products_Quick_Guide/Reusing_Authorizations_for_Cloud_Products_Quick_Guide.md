FEDRAMP® AGENCY AUTHORIZATION PROCESS Reusing Authorizations for Cloud Products Quick Guide

FedRAMP enables agencies to leverage security authorizations for cloud products and services on a government-wide scale. This quide outlines steps and quidance to help agencies quickly and efficiently reuse authorized cloud products within the FedRAMP Marketplace.

## visit the fedramp marketplace STEP 1

- Review the FedRAMP Marketplace to determine if a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) is FedRAMP Authorized.
- · If the CSO is FedRAMP Authorized, there will be an associated security package that is available for agency review.
- Complete and sign the FedRAMP Package Access Request Form and associated Non-Disclosure Agreement.

HELPFUL HINT: One form may be completed even if you are requesting access to multiple cloud products and associated package IDs.

- Send the completed FedRAMP Package Access Request Form to package-access@fedramp.gov.
HELPFUL HINT: Access to the security package will be valid for 60 days. Agencies may email the FedRAMP PMO (package-access@fedramp.gov) and request additional 30-day access increments.

## STEP 2

## CONDUCT PACKAGE REVIEW AND RISK ANALYSIS

- Review the security materials and continuous monitoring deliverables.
HELPFUL HINT: There is an executive summary within the repository for every Agency Authorized CSO.

HELPFUL HINT: Be sure to review the Customer Implementation Summary (CIS) and Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) to understand how to implement customer responsibilities.

- Determine if the CSP needs to meet additional security requirements due to agency data types/mission/business needs.
	- ISSUE AUTHORITY TO OPERATE STEP 3 (ATO) AND SEND AGENCY ATO LETTERS TO FEDRAMP PMO (ATO-LETTER@FEDRAMP.GOV)
- Follow your agency-defined process in issuing an Authority to Operate (ATO).

NOTE: OMB Circular A-130 requires agencies to individually authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk.

- Submit a copy of the signed ATO letter to the FedRAMP PMO (ato-letter@fedramp.gov) to be granted permanent access to the repository.
HELPFUL HINT: Once the agency has sent the signed ATO letter(s) to ato-letter@fedramp.gov, agency users will be granted permanent access to the security package for conducting ongoing, continuous monitoring for authorized services.

STEP 4

## PERFORM CONTINUOUS MONITORING

- Review monthly continuous monitoring deliverables that are provided by the CSP.
HELPFUL HINT: Establishing multi-agency continuous monitoring collaboration groups is highly recommended and can help agencies distribute the workload. Learn more about this in our Guide for Managing Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring.
