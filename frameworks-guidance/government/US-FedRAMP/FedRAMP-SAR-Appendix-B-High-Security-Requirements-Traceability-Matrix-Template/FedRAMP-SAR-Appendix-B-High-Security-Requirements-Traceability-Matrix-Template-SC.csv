For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
 - Crossing the system boundary
 - Between compute instances - including containers
 - From a compute instance to storage
 - Replication between availability zones
 - Transmission of backups to storage
 - From a load balancer to a compute instance
 - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.

The following applies only when choosing SC-8 (5) in lieu of SC-8 (1).
FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters 
SC-8 (5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]
SC-8 (5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information] 

SC-8 Guidance: SC-8 (5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.

Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 

Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2 (1), PE-2 (2), PE-2 (3), PE-3 (2), PE-3 (3), PE-6 (2), and PE-6 (3).

Note: When selecting SC-8 (5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must be added to the SSP.

Examples:
A. Organizations may apply full disk encryption (FDE) to a mobile device where the primary threat is loss of the device while storage is locked. 
B. For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file system level would often provide more protection than FDE against the more likely threat of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.
C. For a database application housing data for multiple customers, encryption with unique keys for each customer at the database record level may be more appropriate.","Examine, Interview, Test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
