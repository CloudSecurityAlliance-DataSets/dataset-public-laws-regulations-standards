Crosswalk between NIST AI RMF 1.0[1] and ISO/IEC 5338:2023 AI system life cycle processes[2] and ISO/IEC 5339 Guidance for AI applications[3]

The AI RMF and the two international standards were developed independently with some shared foundations with ISO/IEC 22989:2022[4] . This document highlights their areas in common and where the AI RMF can be used to inform readers and users of ISO/IEC 5338 and ISO/IEC 5339.

## **AI Risk Management as the Foundation of Responsible Development and Use of AI systems**

Figure 1 shows the *Make*, *Use* and *Impact* perspectives of the stakeholders on an AI application and its context from ISO/IEC 5339. Indicated *in red* in the Figure are where these perspectives could be enhanced by taking the risk management advice and the fundamental aspects of risk from AI RMF.

| "AI risk management is a key<br>component of responsible<br>development and use of AI systems.<br>Responsible AI practices can help align<br>the decisions about AI system design,<br>development, and uses with intended<br>aim and values. Core concepts in<br>responsible AI emphasize human<br>centricity, social responsibility, and<br>sustainability. AI risk management can<br>drive responsible uses and practices by<br>prompting organizations and their<br>internal teams who design, develop,<br>and deploy AI to think more critically<br>about context and potential or<br>unexpected negative and positive<br>impacts. Understanding and managing<br>the risks of AI systems will help to<br>enhance trustworthiness, and in turn,<br>cultivate public trust." ([1] page 1). |              |  |  |

## **AI system life cycle, application context and its audience**

Figure 2 shows the life cycle stages of an AI system in AI RMF aligned with those used in ISO/IEC 5338 and ISO/IEC 5339.

Figure 3 shows the key dimensions and context of an AI system from AI RMF aligned with the processes (5.3.4) and context (5.2) described in ISO/IEC 5339.

Figure 4 shows the alignment between the people and planet dimensions from AI RMF and the impact on various stakeholders in ISO/IEC 5339 (5.3.2, 5.3.3). The AI actors in AI RMF (Appendix A) are also similar to the stakeholders in ISO/IEC 5339.

The characteristics of trustworthy AI systems in AI RMF and the discussion of trustworthiness in ISO/IEC 5339 are compared in Table 1. The discussion of trustworthiness in ISO/IEC 5339 were mostly derived from ISO/IEC 22989 and ISO/IEC 24028 so it does not align exactly with those from AI RMF. The AI RMF characteristics of trustworthy AI systems are socio-technical system attributes. In contrast, ISO/IEC 5339 refers to comparative characteristics as AI application nonfunctional characteristics.

Figure 5 shows the relationship between the AI RMF Core (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE) and the AI application stakeholders' perspectives from ISO/IEC 5339. The AI RMF Core represents a very high-level view and "Governance is designed to be a cross-cutting function to inform and be infused throughout the other three functions" ([1] Figure 5). The MAP function can inform the *Make* perspective. The MEASURE function can inform the *Use* perspective. The MANAGE function can inform the *Impact* perspective.
