## Crosswalk 2 – Concepts NIST AI Risk Management Framework and Japan AI Guidelines for Business

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 (NIST AI RMF)1 is a voluntary resource created to improve the ability to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The Japan AI Guidelines for Business (Japan AI GfB)2 is a framework that promotes innovation and the reduction of risks across the lifecycle by encouraging AI business actors to fully recognize AI risks based on international trends and stakeholders' concerns. The purpose of this crosswalk is to compare and contrast the key concepts addressed in the NIST AI RMF with the concepts addressed in the Japan AI GfB.

Table 1 below presents the crosswalk mapping and analysis. The following list describes each column in the table.

<sup>4</sup> Japan AI GfB includes a number of appendices. Three in particular correspond to different groups of AI

actors: Appendix 3 to AI Developers, Appendix 4 to AI Providers, and Appendix 5 to AI Business Users. 5 This column includes some observations of "No differences noted." This language indicates that no major conceptual differences between the NIST AI RMF and the Japan AI GfB were identified for that topic, though it does not imply that no differences are present.
