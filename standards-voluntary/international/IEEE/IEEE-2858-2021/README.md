# IEEE 2858-2021 - Privacy Engineering Objectives

## Overview
IEEE 2858-2021 specifies privacy objectives for systems that process personally identifiable information (PII). This standard provides a framework for defining and implementing privacy objectives in AI and cloud systems.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Define clear privacy objectives for AI and cloud systems
- Implement privacy-by-design principles systematically
- Support GDPR and privacy regulation compliance
- Establish measurable privacy goals and metrics
- Integrate privacy objectives into system design and operation

## Key Components
- **Privacy Objective Framework**: Systematic approach to defining privacy goals
- **Implementation Guidance**: Practical guidance for achieving privacy objectives
- **Measurement and Assessment**: Methods for evaluating privacy objective achievement
- **Integration with Development**: Incorporating privacy objectives into development processes
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Communicating privacy objectives to relevant parties

## Applications
