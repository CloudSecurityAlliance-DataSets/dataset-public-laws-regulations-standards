# IEEE 1471 - Architecture Description

## Overview
IEEE 1471 (now ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010) establishes requirements for the description of system and software architectures. This standard is important for documenting AI system architectures and cloud infrastructure designs.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Create consistent and comprehensive architecture documentation
- Support communication between architecture stakeholders
- Enable architecture analysis and evaluation
- Facilitate architecture governance and compliance
- Support regulatory documentation requirements for AI systems

## Key Components
- **Architecture Description Framework**: Systematic approach to architecture documentation
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Understanding all parties interested in architecture
- **Viewpoint Definition**: Different perspectives on system architecture
- **Architecture Views**: Specific representations of architecture for different stakeholders
- **Architecture Rationale**: Recording architecture decisions and their justification

## AI and Cloud Architecture Applications
- Documenting AI system architecture for regulatory compliance
- Cloud infrastructure architecture description and documentation
- AI model architecture documentation and governance
- System architecture for AI-enabled applications
- Architecture documentation for distributed AI systems

## Relationship to Other Standards
- **ISO/IEC 42010**: Updated version of IEEE 1471
- **IEEE 12207**: Software lifecycle processes
- **IEEE 15288**: System lifecycle processes
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: AI management system documentation
- **Architecture frameworks and methodologies**
