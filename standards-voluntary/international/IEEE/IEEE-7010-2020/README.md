# IEEE 7010-2020 - Algorithmic Bias Considerations

## Overview
IEEE 7010-2020 provides technical and procedural guidance for assessing bias in algorithms and autonomous systems. This standard establishes systematic approaches for identifying, measuring, and mitigating algorithmic bias throughout the system lifecycle.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Systematically identify and assess algorithmic bias in AI systems
- Implement bias mitigation strategies throughout the AI lifecycle
- Meet EU AI Act fairness requirements for high-risk AI systems
- Support ethical AI development and deployment
- Establish consistent approaches to bias management

## Key Bias Assessment Components

### Types of Algorithmic Bias
- **Historical Bias**: Bias present in training data reflecting past discrimination
- **Representation Bias**: Insufficient representation of certain groups in datasets
- **Measurement Bias**: Systematic errors in data collection or labeling
- **Aggregation Bias**: Inappropriate grouping of different populations
- **Evaluation Bias**: Using inappropriate benchmarks or metrics
- **Deployment Bias**: Bias introduced during system implementation

### Bias Assessment Framework
- **Context Analysis**: Understanding the social and technical context of AI deployment
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Identifying all parties potentially affected by bias
- **Bias Source Analysis**: Systematic identification of potential bias sources
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluating potential harm from algorithmic bias

## Fairness Metrics and Evaluation

### Individual Fairness
- **Similar Treatment**: Ensuring similar individuals receive similar treatment
- **Counterfactual Fairness**: Decisions should be the same in a counterfactual world
- **Causal Fairness**: Avoiding decisions based on protected characteristics

### Group Fairness
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive rates across different groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates across groups
- **Equal Opportunity**: Equal true positive rates across groups
- **Calibration**: Equal predictive accuracy across different groups

### Evaluation Considerations
- **Multiple Metrics**: Using various fairness metrics to assess bias
- **Trade-offs**: Understanding trade-offs between different fairness concepts
