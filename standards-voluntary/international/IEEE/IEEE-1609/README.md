# IEEE 1609 - Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE)

## Overview
IEEE 1609 is a family of standards for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE). While primarily focused on vehicular communications, these standards are relevant for AI and cloud security in connected vehicle systems and intelligent transportation systems.

## Purpose
This standard family helps organizations:
- Secure wireless communications in connected vehicle systems
- Implement authentication and encryption for vehicular networks
- Support secure vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications
- Enable secure deployment of AI systems in transportation infrastructure
- Protect against cybersecurity threats in intelligent transportation systems

## Key Components
- **Security Services**: Authentication, encryption, and integrity for vehicular communications
- **Certificate Management**: PKI infrastructure for vehicular security credentials
- **Network Architecture**: Secure architecture for vehicular communication networks
- **Protocol Security**: Security mechanisms for WAVE communication protocols
- **Threat Mitigation**: Protection against vehicular cybersecurity threats

## AI and Transportation Applications
- Secure communications for autonomous vehicle AI systems
- Protected data exchange between connected vehicles and cloud AI services
- Authentication for AI-powered traffic management systems
- Secure vehicle data collection for AI model training
- Protection of AI algorithms in vehicular edge computing

## Relationship to Other Standards
- **IEEE 802.11**: Wireless security foundation
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Information security management
- **Automotive cybersecurity standards**: ISO/SAE 21434
- **Connected vehicle security frameworks**
