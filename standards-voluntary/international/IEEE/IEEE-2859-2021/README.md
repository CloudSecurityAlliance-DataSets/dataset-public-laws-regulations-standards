# IEEE 2859-2021 - Privacy Engineering Process

## Overview
IEEE 2859-2021 defines a process for privacy engineering in systems that process personally identifiable information (PII). This standard establishes systematic approaches for incorporating privacy considerations throughout the system lifecycle.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Implement systematic privacy engineering processes
- Integrate privacy considerations into development lifecycles
- Support comprehensive privacy protection in AI and cloud systems
- Establish repeatable processes for privacy implementation
- Enable continuous improvement of privacy practices

## Key Components
- **Privacy Process Framework**: Structured approach to privacy engineering
- **Lifecycle Integration**: Incorporating privacy into system development lifecycles
- **Process Activities**: Specific activities for privacy engineering implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring privacy engineering process effectiveness
- **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing enhancement of privacy processes

## Applications
- Privacy-by-design implementation for AI systems
- Cloud service privacy engineering
- Software development lifecycle privacy integration
- Data processing system privacy protection
- Privacy impact assessment processes

## Relationship to Other Standards
