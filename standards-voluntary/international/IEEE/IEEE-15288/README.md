# IEEE 15288 - Systems and Software Engineering - System Lifecycle Processes

## Overview
IEEE 15288 establishes a framework for describing the lifecycle of systems created by humans. This standard defines system lifecycle processes that can be applied to AI systems, cloud infrastructures, and complex technology systems.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Establish systematic approaches to system engineering for AI and cloud systems
- Manage complex system lifecycles from conception through retirement
- Support integration of AI components into larger system architectures
- Ensure consistent system engineering practices across organizations
- Enable effective collaboration between system stakeholders

## Key Components
- **System Lifecycle Processes**: Comprehensive set of processes for system development
- **Process Integration**: Coordinating multiple processes across system lifecycle
- **Stakeholder Management**: Managing stakeholder needs and requirements
- **System Architecture**: Systematic approach to system design and architecture
- **Verification and Validation**: Ensuring systems meet requirements and user needs

## AI and Cloud System Applications
- System engineering for AI-enabled enterprise systems
- Cloud infrastructure system lifecycle management
- Integration of AI components into complex system architectures
- System-of-systems engineering for distributed AI deployments
- Lifecycle management of AI and cloud service ecosystems

## Relationship to Other Standards
- **IEEE 12207**: Software lifecycle processes
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: AI management system requirements
- **ISO/IEC 5338**: AI lifecycle processes
- **ISO 9001**: Quality management system integration
- **Systems engineering best practices**
