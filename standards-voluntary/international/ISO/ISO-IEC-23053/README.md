# ISO/IEC 23053:2022 - Framework for AI Systems Using Machine Learning

## Overview
ISO/IEC 23053 provides a framework for describing AI systems using machine learning (ML) and their associated AI system development processes. It establishes terminology and provides guidance for the development and operation of ML-based AI systems.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Understand the structure and components of ML-based AI systems
- Establish consistent terminology for AI system development
- Plan and manage AI system development projects
- Ensure systematic approach to ML system lifecycle
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders in AI projects

## Key Components
- **AI System Framework**: Conceptual model for ML-based AI systems
- **Development Process Guidance**: Structured approach to AI system development
- **Terminology and Definitions**: Common vocabulary for AI/ML systems
- **System Components**: Description of functional elements in AI systems
- **Lifecycle Considerations**: Guidance for full AI system lifecycle

## AI System Framework Elements
- **Data Management**: Collection, preparation, and management of training data
- **Model Development**: Training, validation, and testing of ML models
- **System Integration**: Incorporating ML models into operational systems
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Ongoing operation and model updates
- **Human Involvement**: Human oversight and intervention capabilities

## Relationship to AI Governance
- **EU AI Act**: Provides foundational structure for risk assessment and documentation
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: Supports AI management system implementation
- **NIST AI RMF**: Aligns with trustworthy AI development principles
- **Model Cards**: Framework supports model documentation requirements

## Development Process Areas
- **Requirements Engineering**: Defining AI system requirements and constraints
- **Data Engineering**: Data collection, preprocessing, and quality assurance
- **Model Engineering**: Algorithm selection, training, and optimization
- **System Engineering**: Integration, deployment, and operational considerations
- **Verification and Validation**: Testing and quality assurance processes

## Target Audience
- AI system developers and engineers
- Project managers for AI initiatives
- AI/ML architects and designers
- Quality assurance and testing teams
- Regulatory and compliance professionals
- Academic researchers in AI

## Business Benefits
- **Systematic Development**: Structured approach reduces project risks
- **Quality Assurance**: Framework supports better AI system quality
- **Communication**: Common terminology improves stakeholder communication
- **Compliance**: Supports regulatory and standard compliance requirements
- **Risk Management**: Systematic approach helps identify and mitigate risks

## Implementation Considerations
- Should be adapted to organization's specific AI use cases
- Requires coordination between technical and business teams
- Integration with existing software development processes recommended
- Regular review and updates as AI technology evolves
- Training staff on framework concepts and terminology
