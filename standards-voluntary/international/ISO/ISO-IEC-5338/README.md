# ISO/IEC 5338:2023 - AI Lifecycle Processes

## Overview
ISO/IEC 5338 defines a set of processes for the engineering of AI systems throughout their lifecycle. It establishes systematic approaches for planning, developing, operating, and maintaining AI systems across various domains and applications.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Implement systematic AI system development processes
- Ensure consistent AI lifecycle management across projects
- Improve AI system quality, reliability, and trustworthiness
- Facilitate collaboration between multidisciplinary AI teams
- Support compliance with AI governance requirements

## Key Processes Covered
- **AI System Planning**: Strategic planning and project initiation
- **AI System Development**: Requirements, design, implementation, and testing
- **AI System Operation**: Deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- **AI System Evolution**: Updates, improvements, and decommissioning
- **Supporting Processes**: Configuration management, quality assurance, risk management

## AI-Specific Process Elements
- **Data Management Processes**: Data collection, preparation, validation, and governance
- **Model Development Processes**: Training, validation, testing, and optimization
- **Human-AI Interaction**: Designing and managing human oversight and intervention
- **Continuous Learning**: Processes for model updates and retraining
- **Fairness and Bias Management**: Systematic approaches to bias detection and mitigation

## Relationship to Other Standards
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: Supports AI management system implementation
- **ISO/IEC 23053**: Complementary framework for ML-based AI systems
- **ISO/IEC 12207**: Based on software lifecycle process standards
- **NIST AI RMF**: Aligns with risk management and trustworthy AI principles
- **EU AI Act**: Supports systematic development for regulatory compliance

## Process Categories
### Development Processes
