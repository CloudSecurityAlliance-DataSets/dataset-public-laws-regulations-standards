# ISO/IEC 29100:2011 - Privacy Framework

## Overview
ISO/IEC 29100 provides a privacy framework for the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) within information and communication technology (ICT) systems. It establishes common privacy terminology, defines actors and their roles, and describes privacy safeguarding considerations.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Establish a common understanding of privacy concepts and principles
- Implement privacy protection measures in ICT systems
- Support compliance with privacy laws and regulations
- Design privacy-preserving systems and services
- Manage privacy risks and stakeholder expectations

## Privacy Framework Components
### Privacy Principles
- **Consent and Choice**: Obtaining informed consent for data processing
- **Purpose Limitation**: Using data only for specified, legitimate purposes
- **Collection Limitation**: Minimizing data collection to what's necessary
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring accuracy, completeness, and relevance
- **Use, Retention and Disclosure Limitation**: Controlling data lifecycle
- **Individual Participation**: Supporting data subject rights and access
- **Security Safeguards**: Protecting PII from unauthorized access
- **Privacy Compliance**: Adhering to applicable privacy laws
- **Openness**: Transparency about data processing practices
- **Individual Recourse**: Providing remedy mechanisms for privacy violations
- **Accountability**: Taking responsibility for privacy protection measures

### Stakeholder Roles
- **PII Principal**: Individual whose personal information is being processed
- **PII Controller**: Entity that determines purposes and means of processing
- **PII Processor**: Entity that processes PII on behalf of controller
- **Third Parties**: External entities involved in PII processing

## AI and Cloud Privacy Applications
- **AI Training Data**: Privacy protection for personal data used in AI model training
- **Cloud Data Processing**: Privacy frameworks for cloud-based data processing
- **Automated Decision Making**: Privacy considerations for AI-driven decisions
- **Data Analytics**: Privacy-preserving approaches to data analysis
- **Cross-Border Data Transfers**: Managing privacy across jurisdictions

## Privacy Safeguarding Considerations
### Technical Safeguards
- Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
- Data minimization and pseudonymization
- Access controls and authentication
- Encryption and secure communications
- Audit logging and monitoring

### Organizational Safeguards
- Privacy policies and procedures
- Staff training and awareness
- Privacy impact assessments
- Incident response procedures
- Third-party management

## Relationship to Other Standards
- **ISO/IEC 27018**: Cloud-specific privacy controls
- **ISO/IEC 27701**: Privacy information management system
- **ISO/IEC 29134**: Privacy impact assessment guidance
- **GDPR**: European privacy regulation alignment
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: AI management system privacy considerations

## Privacy in AI Systems
