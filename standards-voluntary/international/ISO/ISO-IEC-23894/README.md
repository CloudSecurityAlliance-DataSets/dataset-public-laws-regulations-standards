# ISO/IEC 23894:2023 - AI Risk Management

## Overview
ISO/IEC 23894 provides guidance on risk management for artificial intelligence systems. It establishes processes and techniques for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring, and communicating AI-related risks throughout the AI system lifecycle.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Implement systematic AI risk management processes
- Identify and assess AI-specific risks and uncertainties
- Establish risk treatment strategies for AI systems
- Monitor and communicate AI risks to stakeholders
- Support trustworthy and responsible AI development

## Key Risk Management Components
- **AI Risk Identification**: Recognizing potential sources of harm or failure
- **Risk Analysis**: Understanding likelihood and impact of AI risks
- **Risk Evaluation**: Determining risk acceptability and priorities
- **Risk Treatment**: Implementing controls and mitigation measures
- **Risk Monitoring**: Ongoing assessment of risk levels and controls
- **Risk Communication**: Stakeholder engagement and transparency

## AI-Specific Risk Categories
### Technical Risks
- Model performance and accuracy issues
- Bias and fairness concerns
- Robustness and adversarial attacks
- Explainability and interpretability limitations
- Data quality and availability problems

### Operational Risks
- System integration and deployment failures
- Human-AI interaction issues
- Performance degradation over time
- Scaling and resource constraints
- Maintenance and update challenges

### Societal Risks
- Discrimination and bias impacts
- Privacy and data protection violations
- Social and economic disruption
- Accountability and liability issues
- Ethical concerns and value misalignment

## Relationship to AI Governance
- **EU AI Act**: Supports risk-based regulatory compliance approach
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: Integrated with AI management system requirements
- **NIST AI RMF**: Aligns with trustworthy AI risk management framework
- **ISO 31000**: Based on general risk management principles
- **IEEE Standards**: Complementary to IEEE AI ethics and safety standards

## Risk Management Process
### Planning and Context
- Establishing risk management objectives and scope
- Defining AI system boundaries and stakeholders
- Understanding regulatory and ethical requirements
- Setting risk criteria and acceptance levels

### Risk Assessment
- Systematic identification of AI-related risks
- Analysis of risk sources, events, and consequences
- Evaluation of risk likelihood and impact
- Prioritization of risks for treatment

### Risk Treatment
- Selection of appropriate risk treatment options
- Implementation of controls and safeguards
- Design of monitoring and detection systems
- Development of incident response procedures

### Monitoring and Review
- Continuous monitoring of AI system performance
- Regular review of risk assessments and treatments
- Updating risk management based on new information
- Learning from incidents and near-misses

## Target Audience
- AI risk managers and analysts
- AI system developers and operators
- Chief risk officers and risk management teams
- Regulatory and compliance professionals
- AI governance and ethics committees
- Executive leadership responsible for AI strategy

## Business Benefits
- **Proactive Risk Management**: Identify and address risks before they become issues
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Support compliance with AI regulations and standards
- **Stakeholder Trust**: Demonstrate responsible AI risk management
- **Business Continuity**: Reduce likelihood and impact of AI system failures
- **Innovation Enablement**: Balanced approach to risk and innovation

## Implementation Considerations
- Requires multidisciplinary expertise across technical and business domains
- Should be integrated with existing enterprise risk management processes
- Regular updates needed as AI technology and understanding evolve
- Stakeholder engagement essential for comprehensive risk identification
- Balance between risk management and innovation requirements
