# ISO/IEC 27017:2015 - Cloud Security Controls

## Overview
ISO/IEC 27017 provides guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services. It supplements ISO/IEC 27002 with additional implementation guidance for cloud-specific security controls.

## Purpose
This standard helps organizations:
- Implement appropriate security controls for cloud environments
- Manage cloud service provider relationships securely
- Address cloud-specific security risks and challenges
- Ensure secure cloud adoption and migration
- Maintain security consistency across hybrid cloud environments

## Key Components
- **Cloud Service Provider Controls**: Security responsibilities of cloud providers
- **Cloud Service Customer Controls**: Security responsibilities of cloud customers
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Clear delineation of security responsibilities
- **Cloud-Specific Guidance**: Additional controls beyond ISO/IEC 27002
- **Implementation Guidance**: Practical advice for cloud security controls

## AI and Cloud Security Relevance
- **AI Workload Security**: Securing AI training and inference workloads in cloud
- **Data Protection**: Protecting sensitive AI training data in cloud storage
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Ensuring isolation between different AI applications
- **Cloud AI Services**: Securing managed AI services from cloud providers
- **Hybrid AI Deployments**: Managing security across on-premises and cloud AI systems

## Cloud-Specific Security Areas Covered
- **Virtual Network Security**: Network isolation and segmentation
- **Identity and Access Management**: Cloud-specific authentication and authorization
- **Data Location and Sovereignty**: Managing data residency requirements
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Cloud service audit and monitoring capabilities
- **Incident Response**: Coordinating incident response with cloud providers
- **Business Continuity**: Ensuring availability of cloud services

## Relationship to Other Standards
- **ISO/IEC 27001/27002**: Foundation standards for information security
- **ISO/IEC 27018**: Privacy protection in cloud environments
- **CSA CCM**: Cloud Controls Matrix alignment
- **NIST SP 800-53**: Federal security controls for cloud
- **FedRAMP**: US government cloud security authorization

## Target Audience
- Cloud security architects and engineers
- Cloud service providers
- Organizations migrating to cloud
- Security and compliance teams
- Risk management professionals
- Cloud governance teams

## Implementation Considerations
- Requires understanding of shared responsibility models
- Must be adapted to specific cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
- Regular assessment of cloud provider security capabilities
- Integration with existing security management systems
- Ongoing monitoring of cloud security posture
